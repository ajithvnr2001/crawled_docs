Note

All instance size maximums and account limits on this page are defaults and can be increased. To request higher limits, contact your account team or [Cloudflare Support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/contacting-cloudflare-support/).

## Instance Types

The memory, vCPU, and disk space for Containers are set through instance types. You can use one of six predefined instance types or configure a custom instance type.

Instance Type | vCPU | Memory | Disk  
---|---|---|---  
lite | 1/16 | 256 MiB | 2 GB  
basic | 1/4 | 1 GiB | 4 GB  
standard-1 | 1/2 | 4 GiB | 8 GB  
standard-2 | 1 | 6 GiB | 12 GB  
standard-3 | 2 | 8 GiB | 16 GB  
standard-4 | 4 | 12 GiB | 20 GB  
  
For an application that uses the [`default` scheduling policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/configuration/scheduling-policy/), specify the size with the [`instance_type` property](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#containers) in your Worker's Wrangler configuration file. For the `durable_object` policy, pass the named size to `ctx.container.start()` with the runtime `instance` property.

Note

The `dev` and `standard` instance types are preserved for backward compatibility and are aliases for `lite` and `standard-1`, respectively.

### Custom Instance Types

In addition to the predefined instance types, you can configure custom instance types. Field names depend on where you configure the size. Wrangler configuration for the `default` policy uses `vcpu`, `memory_mib`, and `disk_mb`. A `ctx.container.start()` call for the `durable_object` policy uses `vcpu`, `memoryMib`, and `diskMb`.

Refer to the [Wrangler configuration documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#custom-instance-types) or [scheduling policy documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/configuration/scheduling-policy/#choose-an-instance-size-at-runtime) for examples.

Custom instance types have the following constraints:

Resource | Limit  
---|---  
Minimum vCPU | 1  
Maximum vCPU | 4  
Maximum Memory | 12 GiB  
Maximum Disk | 20 GB  
Memory to vCPU ratio | Minimum 3 GiB memory per vCPU  
  
For workloads requiring less than 1 vCPU, use the predefined instance types such as `lite` or `basic`.

## Account limits

The following limits apply per account:

Resource | Limit  
---|---  
Concurrent memory | 6 TiB  
Concurrent vCPU | 1,500  
Concurrent disk | 30 TB  
Image size | Same as instance disk space  
Total image storage per account | 50 GB 1  
  
## Snapshot limits

The following limits apply to [Container snapshots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/guides/snapshots/):

Resource | Limit  
---|---  
Maximum snapshot size | 20 GB  
Snapshot retention | 30 days from creation or the most recent restore  
  
Restoring a snapshot refreshes its 30-day time-to-live.

## Footnotes

  1. Delete container images with `wrangler containers delete` to free up space. If you delete a container image and then [roll back](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/rollbacks/) your Worker to a previous version, this version may no longer work. ↩
