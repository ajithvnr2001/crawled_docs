# Vite plugin

Last updated Oct 18, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

OverviewFeaturesUse casesGet started

The Cloudflare Vite plugin enables a full-featured integration between [Vite ↗︎](https://vite.dev/) and the [Workers runtime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/). Your Worker code runs inside a local [`workerd` ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) process, which closely matches the runtime APIs and behavior of deployed Workers.

Miniflare is not a hardened sandbox

Do not use Miniflare to run untrusted or potentially malicious Worker code directly on your machine. Run the entire development process inside an appropriate secure sandbox, such as a virtual machine.

Miniflare starts a local [`workerd` ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd#warning-workerd-is-not-a-hardened-sandbox) process. This warning applies to default local execution with `wrangler dev`, `vite dev`, `vite preview`, direct Miniflare use, and Miniflare-based testing tools. Setting `remote: true` on a binding changes which resource your code accesses, but your Worker code still executes locally. By contrast, legacy `wrangler dev --remote` executes your Worker code on Cloudflare.

Miniflare is not a security boundary for untrusted code. Although `workerd` attempts to restrict Worker code to configured resources, an implementation bug could allow code to escape those restrictions. The hosted Workers platform applies [additional layers of defense in depth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/security-model/) that Miniflare does not provide locally.

## Features

  * Uses the Vite [Environment API ↗︎](https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment) to integrate Vite with the Workers runtime
  * Provides direct access to [Workers runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/) and [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/)
  * Builds your front-end assets for deployment to Cloudflare, enabling you to build static sites, SPAs, and full-stack applications
  * Produces standard Build Output for `cf build` and `cf deploy`
  * Official support for [TanStack Start ↗︎](https://tanstack.com/start/) and [React Router v8 ↗︎](https://reactrouter.com/) with server-side rendering
  * Leverages Vite's hot module replacement for consistently fast updates
  * Supports `vite preview` for previewing your build output in the Workers runtime prior to deployment



## Use cases

  * [TanStack Start ↗︎](https://tanstack.com/start/)
  * [React Router v8 ↗︎](https://reactrouter.com/)
  * Static sites, such as single-page applications, with or without an integrated backend API
  * Standalone Workers
  * Multi-Worker applications



## Get started

To create a new application from a ready-to-go template, refer to the [TanStack Start](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/tanstack-start/), [React Router](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/), [React](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react/) or [Vue](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/vue/) framework guides.

To create a standalone Worker from scratch, refer to [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/get-started/).
