# Connect to a MySQL database with Cloudflare Workers

Last updated Oct 12, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

OverviewPrerequisites1\. Create a Worker application2\. Enable Node.js compatibility3\. Create a Hyperdrive configuration4\. Query your database from your Worker5\. Deploy your WorkerNext steps

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Cloudflare Workers application and connect it to a MySQL database using [TCP Sockets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) and [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/). The Workers application you create in this tutorial will interact with a product database inside of MySQL.

Note

We recommend using [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/) to connect to your MySQL database. Hyperdrive provides optimal performance and will ensure secure connectivity between your Worker and your MySQL database.

When connecting directly to your MySQL database (without Hyperdrive), the MySQL drivers rely on unsupported Node.js APIs to create secure connections, which prevents connections.

## Prerequisites

To continue:

  1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.

  2. Install [`npm` ↗︎](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).

  3. Install [`Node.js` ↗︎](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Use [Vite+ (`vp env`) ↗︎](https://viteplus.dev/guide/env) to install and manage Node.js versions.

For supported Node.js versions, refer to the [Wrangler system requirements](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/#install-wrangler).

  4. Make sure you have access to a MySQL database.




## 1\. Create a Worker application

First, use the [`create-cloudflare` CLI ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) to create a new Worker application. To do this, open a terminal window and run the following command:

npmyarnpnpm
    
    
    npm create cloudflare@latest -- mysql-tutorial
    
    
    yarn create cloudflare mysql-tutorial
    
    
    pnpm create cloudflare@latest mysql-tutorial

This will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare` ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) package and lead you through a setup wizard.

For setup, select the following options:

  * For _What would you like to start with?_ , choose `Hello World example`.
  * For _Which template would you like to use?_ , choose `Worker only`.
  * For _Which language do you want to use?_ , choose `TypeScript`.
  * For _Do you want to use git for version control?_ , choose `Yes`.
  * For _Do you want to add an AGENTS.md file to help AI coding tools understand Cloudflare APIs?_ , choose `Yes`.
  * For _Do you want to deploy your application?_ , choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).



If you choose to deploy, you will be asked to authenticate (if not logged in already), and your project will be deployed. If you deploy, you can still modify your Worker code and deploy again at the end of this tutorial.

Now, move into the newly created directory:
    
    
    cd mysql-tutorial

## 2\. Enable Node.js compatibility

[Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) is required for database drivers, including mysql2, and needs to be configured for your Workers project.

For compatibility dates of `2026-08-04` or later, Workers and Pages projects enable both `nodejs_compat` and `nodejs_compat_v2` by default. Built-in runtime APIs and polyfills are available without additional configuration. These flags are not used for these compatibility dates. Existing projects do not need to remove them when updating their compatibility date.

If your compatibility date is before `2026-08-04`, add the [`nodejs_compat`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) [compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to opt in:
    
    
    {
    	"compatibility_flags": [
    		"nodejs_compat"
    	]
    }
    
    
    compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]

To turn off [Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) completely for a compatibility date of `2026-08-04` or later, remove the positive flags if present. Then add both `no_nodejs_compat` and `no_nodejs_compat_v2`. For configuration examples, refer to the [Node.js compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

## 3\. Create a Hyperdrive configuration

Create a Hyperdrive configuration using the connection string for your MySQL database.
    
    
    npx wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string="mysql://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name"

This command outputs the Hyperdrive configuration `id` that will be used for your Hyperdrive [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). Set up your binding by specifying the `id` in the Wrangler file.
    
    
    {
    	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    	"name": "hyperdrive-example",
    	"main": "src/index.ts",
    	"upload_source_maps": true,
    	// Set this to today's date
    	"compatibility_date": "2026-10-13",
    	"compatibility_flags": [
    		"nodejs_compat"
    	],
    	// Pasted from the output of `wrangler hyperdrive create <NAME_OF_HYPERDRIVE_CONFIG> --connection-string=[...]` above.
    	"hyperdrive": [
    		{
    			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
    			"id": "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"
    		}
    	]
    }
    
    
    "$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
    name = "hyperdrive-example"
    main = "src/index.ts"
    upload_source_maps = true
    # Set this to today's date
    compatibility_date = "2026-10-13"
    compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
    
    [[hyperdrive]]
    binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
    id = "<ID OF THE CREATED HYPERDRIVE CONFIGURATION>"

## 4\. Query your database from your Worker

Install the [mysql2 ↗︎](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) driver:

npmyarnpnpmbun
    
    
    npm i mysql2@>3.13.0
    
    
    yarn add mysql2@>3.13.0
    
    
    pnpm add mysql2@>3.13.0
    
    
    bun add mysql2@>3.13.0

Note

`mysql2` v3.13.0 or later is required

Add the required Node.js compatibility flags and Hyperdrive binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:
    
    
    {
    	// required for database drivers to function
    	"compatibility_flags": [
    		"nodejs_compat"
    	],
    	// Set this to today's date
    	"compatibility_date": "2026-10-13",
    	"hyperdrive": [
    		{
    			"binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
    			"id": "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"
    		}
    	]
    }
    
    
    compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
    # Set this to today's date
    compatibility_date = "2026-10-13"
    
    [[hyperdrive]]
    binding = "HYPERDRIVE"
    id = "<your-hyperdrive-id-here>"

Create a new `connection` instance and pass the Hyperdrive parameters:
    
    
    // mysql2 v3.13.0 or later is required
    import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    		// Create a new connection on each request. Hyperdrive maintains the underlying
    		// database connection pool, so creating a new connection is fast.
    		const connection = await createConnection({
    			host: env.HYPERDRIVE.host,
    			user: env.HYPERDRIVE.user,
    			password: env.HYPERDRIVE.password,
    			database: env.HYPERDRIVE.database,
    			port: env.HYPERDRIVE.port,
    
    			// Required to enable mysql2 compatibility for Workers
    			disableEval: true,
    		});
    
    		try {
    			// Sample query
    			const [results, fields] = await connection.query("SHOW tables;");
    
    			// Return result rows as JSON
    			return Response.json({ results, fields });
    		} catch (e) {
    			console.error(e);
    			return Response.json(
    				{ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : e },
    				{ status: 500 },
    			);
    		}
    	},
    } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

Note

The minimum version of `mysql2` required for Hyperdrive is `3.13.0`.

## 5\. Deploy your Worker

Run the following command to deploy your Worker:
    
    
    npx wrangler deploy

Your application is now live and accessible at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.
