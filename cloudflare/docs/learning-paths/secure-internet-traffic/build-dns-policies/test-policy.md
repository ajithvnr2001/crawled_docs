OverviewTest a policy in the browser

It is common for a misconfigured Gateway policy to accidentally block traffic to benign sites. To ensure a smooth deployment, we recommend testing a simple policy before deploying DNS filtering to your organization.

## Test a policy in the browser

  1. Go to **Traffic policies** > **Firewall policies**.
  2. Turn off all existing DNS policies.
  3. Turn on any existing security policies or create a policy to block all security categories: 

Selector | Operator | Value | Action  
---|---|---|---  
Security Categories | in | _All security risks_ | Block  
  
  4. Ensure that your browser is not configured to use an alternate DNS resolver. For example, Chrome has a **Use secure DNS** setting that will cause the browser to send requests to 1.1.1.1 and bypass your DNS policies.
  5. In the browser, go to `malware.testcategory.com`. Your browser will display: 
     * The Gateway block page, if your device is connected through the Cloudflare One Client in Traffic and DNS mode.
     * A generic error page, if your device is connected through another method, such as DNS only mode.



Note

[Custom block pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/reusable-components/custom-pages/gateway-block-page/) require you to install a root certificate on the device.

  6. In **Logs** > **Gateway** > **DNS** , verify that you see the blocked domain.
  7. Slowly turn on or add other policies to your configuration.
  8. When testing against frequently-visited sites, you may need to [clear the DNS cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/dns-policies/test-dns-filtering/#clear-dns-cache) in your browser or OS. Otherwise, the DNS lookup will return the locally-cached IP address and bypass your DNS policies.



You have now validated DNS filtering on a test device.
