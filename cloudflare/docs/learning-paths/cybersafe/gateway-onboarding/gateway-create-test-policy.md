OverviewTest a policy in the browser

To ensure a smooth deployment, we recommend testing a simple policy before deploying DNS filtering to your organization.

## Test a policy in the browser

  1. Go to **Traffic policies** > **Firewall policies**.
  2. Create a policy to block all security categories: 

Selector | Operator | Value | Action  
---|---|---|---  
Security Categories | in | _All security risks_ | Block  
  
  3. In the browser, go to `malware.testcategory.com`. You should see a generic Gateway block page.
  4. In **Logs** > **Gateway** > **DNS** , verify that you see the blocked domain.



Note

When testing against frequently-visited sites, you may need to [clear the DNS cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/dns-policies/test-dns-filtering/#clear-dns-cache) in your browser or OS. Otherwise, the DNS lookup will return the locally-cached IP address and bypass your DNS policies.

You have now validated DNS filtering!
