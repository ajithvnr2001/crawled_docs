With a Gateway location created, you have the ability to send traffic to your environment. You can test without risk by changing your DNS resolvers in your browser or network settings.

## Change DNS resolver at the network level

To configure your device to send traffic to Gateway:

## Change DNS resolver in the browser

To configure your browser to send traffic to Gateway:

  1. Obtain your DNS over HTTPS (DoH) address:

     1. Go to **Traffic policies** > **DNS locations**.
     2. Select the default location.
     3. Copy your **DNS over HTTPS** hostname: `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`
  2. Follow the configuration instructions for your browser:

Mozilla Firefox

     1. In Firefox, go to **Settings**.
     2. In **Privacy & Security**, go to **DNS over HTTPS**.
     3. Under **Enable secure DNS using** , select _Max Protection_.
     4. In **Choose provider** , choose _Custom_.
     5. In the field, enter `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.

Firefox is now configured to use your DoH endpoint. For more information on configuring DoH settings in Firefox, refer to [Mozilla's documentation ↗︎](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/dns-over-https).

Note

If you want to enforce DNS policies through the Cloudflare One Client instead of over DoH, you can disable DoH for your organization by blocking the [Firefox DoH canary domain ↗︎](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/canary-domain-use-application-dnsnet).

Google Chrome

     1. In Chrome, go to **Settings** > **Privacy and security** > **Security**.
     2. Scroll down and turn on **Use secure DNS**.
     3. Select **With Custom**.
     4. In the **Enter custom provider** field, enter `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.

Read more about [enabling DNS over HTTPS ↗︎](https://www.chromium.org/developers/dns-over-https) on Chrome.

Microsoft Edge

     1. In Microsoft Edge, go to **Settings**.
     2. Select **Privacy, Search, and Services** , and scroll down to **Security**.
     3. Turn on **Use secure DNS**.
     4. Select **Choose a service provider**.
     5. In the **Enter custom provider** field, enter `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.

Brave

     1. In Brave, go to **Settings** > **Security and Privacy** > **Security**.
     2. Turn on **Use secure DNS**.
     3. Select **With Custom**.
     4. In the **Enter custom provider** field, enter `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.

Safari

Currently, Safari does not support DNS over HTTPS.

  3. Verify that third-party firewall or TLS decryption software does not inspect or block traffic to the DoH endpoint: `https://<YOUR_DOH_SUBDOMAIN>.cloudflare-gateway.com/dns-query`.
