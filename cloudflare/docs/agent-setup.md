# Agent setup

Connect your AI coding agent to Cloudflare, then build and deploy straight from your editor or terminal.

## Understanding agents

Common types, concepts, and tradeoffs.

### Workflow

Where the agent runs changes how you interact with it.

Terminal

Runs in a shell. Best for automation, scripting, and CI pipelines.

IDE

Full code editor with AI first-class. Visual diffs, multi-file edits.

Cloud

Hosted infrastructure. Ideal for async, long-running work.

Extension

Plugs into an existing editor. Lightest install, keeps your setup.

### Key concepts

The vocabulary you'll run into when comparing agents.

Skills

Reusable prompt packages that teach an agent about a specific domain. Think of them as plugins made of instructions plus slash commands.

MCP

The Model Context Protocol — a standard that lets agents call external tools and APIs. Connect an MCP server and the agent knows how to use it.

Model flexibility

Which foundation models you can use. **Locked** supports only the vendor's own models. **BYOK** (Bring Your Own Key) lets you bring your own API key. **Multi-provider** supports several providers out of the box.

Context

How the agent retains information about your project. **Session** only remembers the current conversation. **Project memory** persists across sessions. **Indexed codebase** builds a searchable index of your whole repository.

### Common tradeoffs

Decisions you'll make when picking an agent.

Cloudvs.Local

Cloud agents run on hosted infrastructure and read your code over the network. Local agents run on your own machine, with no code leaving it.

Proprietaryvs.Open source

Proprietary agents ship under a closed license you don't control. Open-source agents publish their source under an open license, so you can read, modify, or fork the code.

Locked modelvs.BYOK

Locked agents only work with the vendor's own proprietary models. BYOK agents let you bring your own API key and switch between providers and models.

Sessionvs.Indexed codebase

Session context resets when you close the conversation. An indexed codebase is built up front and persists, letting the agent retrieve any file in the repo on demand.
