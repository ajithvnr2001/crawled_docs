# cf.timings.worker_msec

`cf.timings.worker_msec``Integer`

The time spent executing a Cloudflare Worker in milliseconds.

This field provides the wall-clock time that a Cloudflare Worker spent handling the request, measured in milliseconds.

Use this field to identify slow Worker executions, set up alerts for performance regressions, or add Worker execution time as a request header using Transform Rules for downstream observability.

If the request did not invoke a Worker, the value of this field will be `0`.

Example value:
    
    
    12

Example usage:
    
    
    # Matches requests where the Worker execution time exceeded 500 milliseconds
    cf.timings.worker_msec > 500
