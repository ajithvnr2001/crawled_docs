# http.request.body.mime

`http.request.body.mime``String`

The MIME type of the request detected from the request body.

Supports the most common MIME types of the following general categories: video, audio, image, application, text.

Example value:
    
    
    "image/jpeg"

Example usage:
    
    
    http.request.body.mime in {"image/bmp" "image/gif" "image/jpeg" "image/png" "image/tiff"}

Caution

All `http.request.body.*` fields (except [ `http.request.body.size`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.request.body.size/)) handle a given maximum body size, which varies per plan. For Enterprise customers, the maximum body size is 128 KB. For other paid plans, the limit is lower by default — reach out to your account team or to Cloudflare Support to increase the limit. For users in the Free plan, the limit is 1 MB.

You cannot define expressions that rely on request body data beyond the maximum size set for your plan. If the request body is larger, the body fields will contain a truncated value and the [`http.request.body.truncated`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.request.body.truncated/) field will be set to `true`. The [`http.request.body.size`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.request.body.size/) field will contain the full size of the request without any truncation.

The maximum body size applies only to the values of HTTP body fields — the origin server will still receive the complete request body.
