OverviewFeaturesMore resources

Get Cloudflare's security and performance while using your own IPs.

Enterprise-only

When you use Cloudflare as a [reverse proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/), Cloudflare responds to DNS queries for proxied records with Cloudflare-owned IP addresses1. For some organizations, it is important to keep their website or application associated with IP addresses they already own rather than using Cloudflare's.

With Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP), Cloudflare announces your IP prefixes in all our locations. Use your IPs with [Magic Transit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/), [Spectrum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/), [CDN services](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/), or Gateway [DNS locations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/resolver-endpoints/) and [dedicated egress IPs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/egress-policies/dedicated-egress-ips/).

## Footnotes

  1. Without BYOIP, when your domain's records are `proxied`, Cloudflare responds with a Cloudflare-owned [anycast IP address](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/). ↩
