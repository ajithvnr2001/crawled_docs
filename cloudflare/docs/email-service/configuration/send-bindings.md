OverviewBinding typesNext steps

When you add a `send_email` binding to a Worker, you can restrict its sender and recipient addresses. The following Wrangler configuration variants apply these restrictions. For the binding API, refer to the [Email Sending Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/workers-api/).

## Binding types

Each `send_email` entry supports a different restriction choice. The sender address must belong to an onboarded Email Service domain.

  * **No restriction attribute** : The binding can send to any verified destination address in your account.
  * **`destination_address`** : The binding can only send to the single destination address configured here. If you call `send()` with `to` set to `null` or `undefined`, the configured address is used.
  * **`allowed_destination_addresses`** : The binding can only send to addresses listed in this allowlist.
  * **`allowed_sender_addresses`** : The binding can only send from the addresses listed in this allowlist.


    
    
    {
    	"send_email": [
    		// Send to any verified destination
    		{ "name": "EMAIL" },
    		// Send only to a single fixed destination
    		{
    			"name": "NOTIFY_OPS",
    			"destination_address": "ops@yourdomain.com",
    		},
    		// Send only to addresses on an allowlist
    		{
    			"name": "EMAIL_TEAM",
    			"allowed_destination_addresses": [
    				"alice@yourdomain.com",
    				"bob@yourdomain.com",
    			],
    		},
    		// Send only from addresses on an allowlist
    		{
    			"name": "RESTRICTED_EMAIL",
    			"allowed_sender_addresses": [
    				"noreply@yourdomain.com",
    				"support@yourdomain.com",
    			],
    		},
    	],
    }
    
    
    [[send_email]]
    name = "EMAIL"
    
    [[send_email]]
    name = "NOTIFY_OPS"
    destination_address = "ops@yourdomain.com"
    
    [[send_email]]
    name = "EMAIL_TEAM"
    allowed_destination_addresses = [ "alice@yourdomain.com", "bob@yourdomain.com" ]
    
    [[send_email]]
    name = "RESTRICTED_EMAIL"
    allowed_sender_addresses = [ "noreply@yourdomain.com", "support@yourdomain.com" ]

## Next steps

  * [Email Sending Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/api/send-emails/workers-api/) — send emails from a Worker using the binding.
  * [Domain configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/configuration/domains/) — onboard the domains you send from.
