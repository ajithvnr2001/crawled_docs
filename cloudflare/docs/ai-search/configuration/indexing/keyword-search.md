OverviewEnable keyword searchKeyword tokenizerKeyword match modeLimits

Enable keyword search to match chunks that contain your query terms exactly. For an overview of search modes, refer to [Search modes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/concepts/search-modes/).

## Enable keyword search

Set `index_method.keyword` to `true` when creating or updating an instance. You can use keyword search on its own or alongside vector search for [hybrid search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/indexing/hybrid-search/).

Field | Type | Default | Description  
---|---|---|---  
`vector` | boolean | `true` | Enable vector (semantic) search.  
`keyword` | boolean | `true` | Enable keyword (BM25) search.  
  
At least one of `vector` or `keyword` must be `true`. Changing `index_method` triggers a full reindex of your content.

The `keyword` field defaults to `true`.
    
    
    const instance = await env.AI_SEARCH.create({
    	id: "my-instance",
    	index_method: {
    		vector: false,
    		keyword: true,
    	},
    });

## Keyword tokenizer

The `keyword_tokenizer` field (inside `indexing_options`) controls how text is split into tokens. Changing this triggers a full reindex.

Value | Default | Description  
---|---|---  
`porter` | Yes | Applies Porter stemming. "running" matches "run." Best for natural language.  
`trigram` | No | Overlapping 3-character windows. "config" matches "configuration." Best for code.  
  
Japanese, Chinese, and Korean content

The `porter` tokenizer splits text on spaces and punctuation, so it does not work well for Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. Japanese and Chinese do not separate words with spaces, and Korean attaches particles to words. Keyword search with `porter` may return no results for queries in these languages.

If your content is in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, use the `trigram` tokenizer. With `trigram`, keyword search matches these queries, including full natural-language questions, against overlapping three-character sequences in your content. Words shorter than three characters cannot be matched on their own.

## Keyword match mode

The `keyword_match_mode` field (inside `retrieval_options`) controls how multiple query terms are combined.

Value | Default | Description  
---|---|---  
`and` | Yes | All query terms must appear. Higher precision, fewer results.  
`or` | No | Any query term can match. Higher recall, more results.  
  
You can override `keyword_match_mode` per request:
    
    
    const instance = env.AI_SEARCH.get("my-instance");
    
    const results = await instance.search({
    	messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is Cloudflare?" }],
    	ai_search_options: {
    		retrieval: {
    			keyword_match_mode: "or",
    		},
    	},
    });

## Limits

Instances with keyword search enabled support up to 500,000 files per instance on the Workers Paid tier, compared to 1,000,000 for vector-only instances. Refer to [Limits and pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/platform/limits-pricing/) for the full list of limits.
