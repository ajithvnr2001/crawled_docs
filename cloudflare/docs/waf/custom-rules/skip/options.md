The following sections cover the available skip options in custom rules.

## Skip the remaining custom rules (current ruleset)

  * Dashboard option: **All remaining custom rules**
  * API action parameter: `ruleset`



Skips the remaining rules in the current ruleset.

## Skip phases

Note

When an account-level skip rule uses the phases action parameter, Cloudflare skips the specified phases at both the account and zone levels for matching requests.

  * Dashboard options: **All rate limiting rules** , **All Super Bot Fight Mode rules** , and **All managed rules**
  * API action parameter: `phases`



Skips the execution of one or more phases. Based on the phases you can skip, this option effectively allows you to skip [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), [Super Bot Fight Mode rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/super-bot-fight-mode/), and/or [WAF Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/).

The phases you can skip are the following:

  * `http_ratelimit`
  * `http_request_sbfm`
  * `http_request_firewall_managed`



Refer to [Phases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/about/phases/) for more information.

Notes

Currently, you cannot skip [Bot Fight Mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-fight-mode/), only Super Bot Fight Mode.

Skipping a phase does not skip security products that run outside the Ruleset Engine, such as [Browser Integrity Check](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/) or [Zone Lockdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/). To skip those products, use the Skip products option instead.

## Skip products

  * API action parameter: `products`



Skips specific security products that are not based on the Ruleset Engine. The products you can skip are the following:

Product name in the dashboard | API value  
---|---  
[Zone Lockdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/) | `zoneLockdown`  
[User Agent Blocking](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/user-agent-blocking/) | `uaBlock`  
[Browser Integrity Check](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/) | `bic`  
[Hotlink Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/hotlink-protection/) | `hot`  
[Security Level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/security-level/) | `securityLevel`  
[Rate limiting rules (Previous version)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/) | `rateLimit`  
[Managed rules (Previous version)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/) | `waf`  
  
The API values in the table are case-sensitive.

## Skip the remaining custom rules (current phase)

  * Dashboard option: **All remaining custom rules in this phase** (zone-level rules only)
  * API action parameter: `phase`



The `phase: "current"` option is supported only in zone-level custom and entry point rulesets for the `http_request_firewall_custom` phase. When matched, it skips all remaining rules in the phase, including rules in custom rulesets executed later.

## Other options

### Log requests matching the skip rule

  * Dashboard option: **Log matching requests**
  * API action parameter: `logging` > `enabled` (boolean, optional)



When disabled, Cloudflare will not log any requests matching the current skip rule, and these requests will not appear in [Security Events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-events/).

If you do not specify this option in the API, the default value is `true` for custom rules with the skip action (logs requests matching the skip rule).
