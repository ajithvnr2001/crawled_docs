Caution

The Private Network application type can no longer be created from the dashboard. If you do not already have a legacy private network application, use a [self-hosted application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/self-hosted-private-app/) to secure a private IP address instead.

Existing **Private Network** applications continue to function and can still be managed. These applications were originally configured with the following steps:

  1. In the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Zero Trust** > **Access controls** > **Applications** > **Add an application**.

  2. Select **Private Network**.

  3. Name your application.

  4. For **Application type** , select _Destination IP_.

  5. For **Value** , enter the IP address for your application (for example, `10.128.0.7`).

Note

If you would like to create a policy for an IP/CIDR range instead of a specific IP address, you can build a [Gateway Network policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/) using the **Destination IP** selector.

  6. Configure your [App Launcher](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/app-launcher/) visibility and logo.

  7. Select **Next**. You will see two auto-generated Gateway Network policies: one that allows access to the destination IP and another that blocks access.

  8. Modify the policies to include additional identity-based conditions. For example:

     * **Policy 1**

Selector | Operator | Value | Logic | Action  
---|---|---|---|---  
Destination IP | in | `10.128.0.7` | And | Allow  
User Email | matches regex | `.*@example.com` |  |   
  
     * **Policy 2**

Selector | Operator | Value | Action  
---|---|---|---  
Destination IP | in | `10.128.0.7` | Block  
  
Policies are evaluated in [numerical order](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/order-of-enforcement/#order-of-precedence), so a user with an email ending in @example.com will be able to access `10.128.0.7` while all others will be blocked. For more information on building network policies, refer to our [dedicated documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/).

  9. Select **Add application**.




Your application will appear on the **Applications** page.
