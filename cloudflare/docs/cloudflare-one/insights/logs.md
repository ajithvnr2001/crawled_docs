## Log Explorer Beta

Log Explorer users can store Zero Trust logs directly within Cloudflare in an [R2 bucket](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) and access them with the dashboard or API. Log Explorer supports the following Zero Trust datasets:

  * [Access requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/access_requests/) (`FROM access_requests`)
  * [CASB Findings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/casb_findings/) (`FROM casb_findings`)
  * [Device posture results](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/device_posture_results/) (`FROM device_posture_results`)
  * [Gateway DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway_dns/) (`FROM gateway_dns`)
  * [Gateway HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway_http/) (`FROM gateway_http`)
  * [Gateway Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/gateway_network/) (`FROM gateway_network`)
  * [Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/) (`FROM zero_trust_network_sessions`)

## Customer Metadata Boundary

You can use Cloudflare Zero Trust with the Data Localization Suite to restrict data storage to a specific geographic region. For more information, refer to [Customer Metadata Boundary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/metadata-boundary/).

## Data privacy

For more information on how we use this data, refer to our [Privacy Policy ↗︎](https://www.cloudflare.com/application/privacypolicy/).

## Footnotes

  1. Enterprise users on per query plans cannot store DNS logs via Cloudflare. You can still export logs via [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/). For more information, contact your account team. ↩
