OverviewBenefitsLimitations

When you choose an API deployment, email messages only reach Email security after they have already reached a user's inbox.

Then, through an integration with your email provider, Email security can [auto-move messages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/auto-moves/) based on your organization's policies.

## Benefits

When you choose API deployment, you get the following benefits:

  * Easy protection for complex email architectures, without requiring any change to mailflow operations.
  * Agentless deployment for Microsoft 365.



## Limitations

However, API deployment also has the following disadvantages:

  * Email security is dependent on Microsoft's Graph API, and outages will increase the message dwell time in the inbox.
  * Your email provider may throttle API requests from Email security.
  * Email security requires read and write access to mailboxes.
  * Requires API support from your email provider (does not typically support on-premise providers).
  * Detection rates may be lower if multiple solutions exist.
  * Messages cannot be modified or quarantined.
