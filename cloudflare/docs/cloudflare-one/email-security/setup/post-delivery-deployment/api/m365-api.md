This guide will instruct you through setting up Microsoft 365 with Email security via the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Prerequisites

To use Email security, you will need to have:

  * A [Cloudflare account ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
  * A [Zero Trust organization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/setup/#2-create-a-zero-trust-organization)
  * A domain to protect



## Enable Email security via the dashboard

  1. Log in to [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and select **Email security**..
  2. Select **Overview**. Select one of the following options depending on your use case:


  * If you have not purchased Email security, select **Contact sales**.
  * If you have not associated any integration: 
    * Select **Set up**.
    * Choose **MS Graph API** > **Authorize**.
    * Refer to Enable Microsoft integration to continue the onboarding process.
  * If you have associated an integration, but have not connected a domain: 
    * Select **Connect a domain**.
    * Choose **MS Graph API**. Refer to Connect your domains to connect your domain(s).



### Enable Microsoft integration

To enable Microsoft integration:

  1. **Configure policy** : Choose how [CASB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/) interacts with your data. Select **Read-only mode** or **Read-Write mode**. It is recommended that you choose **Read-Write mode**.
  2. **Name integration** : Add your integration name, then select **Continue**.
  3. **Authorize integration** : 
     * Select **Authorize**. Selecting **Authorize** will take you to the Microsoft Sign in page where you will have to enter your email address.
     * Once you enter your email address, select **Next**.
     * After selecting **Next** , the system will show a dialog box with a list of requested permissions. Select **Accept** to authorize Email security. Upon authorization, you will be redirected to a page where you can review details and enroll integration.
  4. **Review details** : Review your integration details, then: 
     * Select **Complete Email security set up** where you will be able to connect your domains and configure auto-moves.
     * Select **Continue to Email security**.



Continue with Connect your domains for the next steps.

### Connect your domains

On the **Set up Email security** page, you will be able to connect your Microsoft domains. To connect your domains:

  1. **Connect domains** : Select at least one domain. Then, select **Continue**.
  2. (Optional) **Modify default scanning** : You can configure which folder Email security can scan.
  3. (Optional - select **Skip for now** to skip this step) **Redirect messages** : Refer to [Auto-moves](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/settings/detection-settings/auto-moves/) to learn what auto-moves are, and how to configure auto-moves.
  4. **Review details** : Review your connected domains, then select **Go to Domains**.



Your domains are now connected successfully.

### Connect new domains

To connect new domains:

  1. In [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), select **Email security**.
  2. Select **Settings** > **Domain management** > **Domains** , then select **View**.
  3. Select **Add a domain**.
  4. Select a method for connecting your mail environment to Email security: 
     * If you select **MS Graph API** , refer to [Enable Microsoft integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/m365-api/#enable-microsoft-integration).
     * If you select BCC/Journaling, choose how to connect your domains: 
       * If you select **Integrate with MS** , refer to [Enable Microsoft integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/api/m365-api/#enable-microsoft-integration).
       * If you select **Integrate with Google** , refer to [Connect your domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/bcc-setup/gmail-bcc-setup/connect-domains/).
       * If you select **Manual add** , refer to [Enter domain manually](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/setup/post-delivery-deployment/bcc-journaling/journaling-setup/manual-add/#enter-domain-manually).



## Prevent Cloudflare from scanning a domain

If you want to prevent Cloudflare from scanning a domain:

  1. In [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), select **Email security**.
  2. Go to **Settings** > **Domain management** > **Domains** , then select **View**.
  3. On the **Domain management** page, select the domain you do not want to be scanned.
  4. Select the three dots > **Stop scanning**.
