## [Vectorize indexes now support up to 20 million vectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-04-index-capacity-20-million/)

[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)

You can now store up to 20 million vectors in a single Vectorize index, doubling the previous limit of 10 million vectors. This enables larger-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications without splitting data across multiple indexes.

Vectorize continues to support indexes with up to 1,536 dimensions per vector at 32-bit precision. Refer to the [Vectorize limits documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/platform/limits/) for complete details.

## [Reduced end-to-end latency for vector changes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-30-improved-wal-throughput/)

[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)

We have greatly improved the throughput of the Vectorize [write-ahead log (WAL) ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-vectorize-a-distributed-vector-database-on-cloudflare-developer-platform/#the-wal). As a result, we have significantly reduced the end-to-end latency for a vector change to become queryable: median latency has dropped from 2 minutes to under 30 seconds, and p99 latency from 5 minutes to under 2 minutes.

![Vectorize p99 WAL batch end-to-end latency improved](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2542,height=1184,format=webp/_astro/vectorize-p99-wal-batch-end-to-end-latency-improvement.k8gtzlG7.png)

This means inserts, upserts, and deletes are reflected in query results faster, improving the freshness of semantic search, recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workloads. You do not need to change your code or configuration to benefit from this improvement.

For more information, refer to the [Vectorize documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/).

## [Billable usage and budget alerts now in product sidebars](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-04-billable-usage-product-sidebar/)

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)[R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)[KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/)[Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/)[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)[Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/)

Pay-as-you-go customers can now view billable usage and create [budget alerts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-04-13-billable-usage-dashboard-and-budget-alerts/) directly from the product overview pages for [Workers & Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/), [Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/), [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/), [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), and [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/). A new sidebar widget shows current-period spend and the billing cycle date range, alongside a button to create a budget alert.

The widget pulls from the same data as the [Billable Usage dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-04-13-billable-usage-dashboard-and-budget-alerts/) and aligns to your billing cycle (or the current day on Free plans), so the numbers match your invoice. Enterprise contract accounts are not yet supported.

![Billable usage widget in the Durable Objects product sidebar showing current-period spend and a breakdown by service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2872,height=1614,format=webp/_astro/2026-06-04-billable-usage-product-sidebar.BUuIokn_.png)

Selecting **Create budget alert** opens the budget alert flow inline so you can set a dollar threshold in the same place you are reviewing usage. Budget alerts apply to your total account-level spend across all products, not just the product page you create them from.

For more information, refer to the [Usage-based billing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/billing/).

## [Return up to 50 query results with values or metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-03-16-topk-limit-increased-to-50/)

[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)

You can now set `topK` up to `50` when a Vectorize query returns values or full metadata. This raises the previous limit of `20` for queries that use `returnValues: true` or `returnMetadata: "all"`.

Use the higher limit when you need more matches in a single query response without dropping values or metadata. Refer to the [Vectorize API reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/reference/client-api/) for query options and current `topK` limits.

## [Vectorize indexes now support up to 10 million vectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-01-23-increased-index-capacity/)

[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)

You can now store up to 10 million vectors in a single Vectorize index, doubling the previous limit of 5 million vectors. This enables larger-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications without splitting data across multiple indexes.

Vectorize continues to support indexes with up to 1,536 dimensions per vector at 32-bit precision. Refer to the [Vectorize limits documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/platform/limits/) for complete details.

## [List all vectors in a Vectorize index with the new list-vectors operation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-08-26-vectorize-list-vectors/)

[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)

You can now list all vector identifiers in a Vectorize index using the new `list-vectors` operation. This enables bulk operations, auditing, and data migration workflows through paginated requests that maintain snapshot consistency.

The operation is available via Wrangler CLI and REST API. Refer to the [list-vectors best practices guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/best-practices/list-vectors/) for detailed usage guidance.

## [Create fully-managed RAG pipelines for your AI applications with AutoRAG](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-04-07-autorag-open-beta/)

[AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/)[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)

[AutoRAG](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/) is now in open beta, making it easy for you to build fully-managed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines without managing infrastructure. Just upload your docs to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/get-started/), and AutoRAG handles the rest: embeddings, indexing, retrieval, and response generation via API.

With AutoRAG, you can:

  * **Customize your pipeline:** Choose from [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai) models, configure chunking strategies, edit system prompts, and more.
  * **Instant setup:** AutoRAG provisions everything you need from [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize), [AI gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway), to pipeline logic for you, so you can go from zero to a working RAG pipeline in seconds.
  * **Keep your index fresh:** AutoRAG continuously syncs your index with your data source to ensure responses stay accurate and up to date.
  * **Ask questions:** Query your data and receive grounded responses via a [Workers binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/workers-binding/) or [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/rest-api/).



Whether you're building internal tools, AI-powered search, or a support assistant, AutoRAG gets you from idea to deployment in minutes.

Get started in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/autorag) or check out the [guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/get-started/) for instructions on how to build your RAG pipeline today.
