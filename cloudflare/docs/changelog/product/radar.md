## [RPKI ASPA path validation on Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-24-radar-aspa-validation/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) adds an [ASPA validation tool ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/aspa-validation) to its [Routing section ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing). Enter a BGP `AS_PATH` and the tool checks it against the [Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aspa-secure-internet/) records currently published in the RPKI, returning a verdict of `Valid`, `Invalid`, or `Unknown`. An `Invalid` verdict means no chain of provider authorizations covers the whole path, which is the signature of a route leak.

Validation follows [draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/), so verdicts match those produced by validators implementing the same draft. The draft is still a work in progress and not yet an RFC.

#### Enter a path

Paths are read in BGP wire order: the rightmost AS is the origin, and the leftmost AS is the one closest to the collector or router that observed the route. AS numbers can be separated by spaces, commas, or hyphens, with or without an `AS` prefix. The full ASPA snapshot is loaded into the browser once, so the verdict, graph, and trace update as the path is edited, with no further requests. A set of example paths covers the interesting cases, including a route leak with an AS0 ASPA, where an AS declares that it has no providers at all.

#### Choose an algorithm

The draft defines two verification algorithms that differ only in whether a down-ramp is permitted:

  * **Upstream** ([section 5.4 ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification#section-5.4)) — for routes received from a customer, peer, route server client, or route server. Only an up-ramp is permitted.
  * **Downstream** ([section 5.5 ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification#section-5.5)) — for routes received from a provider. Both an up-ramp and a down-ramp are permitted.



An **up-ramp** is the run of consecutive customer-to-provider hops from the origin to the apex of the path, and a **down-ramp** is the equivalent run from the announcing neighbor back to that apex. The tool evaluates both algorithms at once and labels each with its verdict, so a path that is legitimate when received from one session type and a leak when received from another is visible without switching modes. Selecting an algorithm drives the graph and the trace.

#### Read the result

The **ASPA validation graph** draws the path hop by hop, labeling each AS with its role, whether it publishes an ASPA, and how many providers that ASPA authorizes. Every hop is marked `Provider+`, `Not Provider+`, or `No attestation`, and the maximum and minimum bounds of each ramp are drawn against the length of the path. Hops that no ramp reaches are highlighted, because a path the ramps cannot cover end to end is `Invalid`. The accompanying **ASPA records** table lists every AS in the path with its ASPA status and its authorized providers, each linked to its Radar AS page.

![ASPA validation graph for the path 1003 6939 1299 553, showing a Valid verdict under the downstream algorithm, the Provider+, Not Provider+, and No attestation outcome on each hop, and the up-ramp and down-ramp bounds that together cover the path](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=1222,format=webp/_astro/aspa-validation-graph.DQUq8KCm.png)

#### Follow the algorithm

The **Algorithm step by step** section shows the derivation rather than just the answer. Two columns run the same scans under different stopping rules: the upper bounds, which test for `Invalid` and stop only on `Not Provider+`, and the lower bounds, which test for `Unknown` and also stop on `No Attestation`. A hop is `Not Provider+` when the AS publishes an ASPA that does not list the next AS as a provider, and `No Attestation` when the AS publishes no ASPA at all. Each column lists the outcome for every hop scanned, marks where the scan stopped, gives the resulting ramp length, and then evaluates the verdict rule with the numbers filled in.

![Step-by-step trace for the same path, with the upper-bound and lower-bound columns each listing the up-ramp and down-ramp scans, the ramp lengths they produce, and the verdict rule that neither Invalid nor Unknown satisfies, leaving a Valid verdict](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1392,height=586,format=webp/_astro/aspa-validation-algorithm-trace.Bb8SM4wT.png)

#### Share a validation

The path and the selected algorithm are kept in the URL, so a link reproduces a result exactly — for example, this [route leak with an AS0 ASPA ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/aspa-validation?path=22652-1299-9498-149765-14789). Appending `&mode=upstream` pins the link to the upstream algorithm. The graph is a standard Radar widget, so it can also be embedded or shared as an image.

The records behind the tool are the same ones served by the [`/bgp/rpki/aspa/snapshot`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/subresources/rpki/subresources/aspa/methods/snapshot/) endpoint of the [`ASPA`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/subresources/rpki/subresources/aspa/) API, and the number of records loaded and the snapshot timestamp are shown alongside the input.

Try the [ASPA validation tool ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/aspa-validation) with a path of your own.

## [AS-level connectivity and upstream providers on Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-07-radar-as-connectivity-upstreams/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) expands its [Routing section ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing) with two widgets on AS pages, such as [AS13335 ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as13335), that describe how a network reaches the rest of the Internet: the paths it takes toward the [Tier-1 ↗︎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network) networks, and the mix of direct upstreams carrying its routes. Both are derived from [RouteViews ↗︎](https://www.routeviews.org/) RIB snapshots, unioned across selected collectors.

#### AS-level connectivity

The **AS-level connectivity** graph aggregates the BGP paths an AS uses to reach the Tier-1 networks, unioned across all the prefixes it announces, as observed by selected RouteViews collectors. It reads from left to right, starting at the queried AS and ending at the Tier-1 networks, and each node is labeled with its AS number, country, and organization name. Tier-1 nodes are marked so they stand apart from the intermediate networks that lead to them.

By default, the graph shows the network's direct connections to Tier-1 networks plus the indirect paths, which keeps the view readable. A **Show full paths** toggle expands it to every observed path, including transit through Tier-1 networks the AS already connects to. An IP version selector switches between IPv4 and IPv6, because the paths reaching Tier-1 networks may differ between the two address families.

![AS-level connectivity graph for AS13335, showing Tier-1 networks it reaches directly alongside paths that reach others through intermediate networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=1526,format=webp/_astro/as-level-connectivity-graph.DGv8lrUx.png)

This is the AS-level counterpart to the **Real-time connectivity** graph on prefix pages, such as the one for [1.1.1.0/24 ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/1.1.1.0/24). Instead of covering a single prefix, it covers the union of paths for all prefixes an AS announces, which makes it a fast way to read a network's transit hierarchy: which providers it depends on, how many hops separate it from the core, and whether its paths to the core are diverse or concentrated. For more information on the prefix-level graph, refer to [BGP real-time routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#bgp-real-time-routes).

#### Upstream providers

The **Upstream providers** widget tracks the share of an AS's observed paths carried by each of its direct upstream networks over time, drawn as a stacked area chart. Up to 10 upstreams appear as their own series and the remaining ones are grouped into **Other**. Transit changes such as adding a provider, dropping one, or moving traffic between them appear as movement between bands rather than as a single aggregate number. As with the connectivity graph, an IP version selector switches between IPv4 and IPv6.

![Stacked area chart of the share of AS13335's observed paths carried by each of its top 10 direct upstreams, with the remainder grouped into Other](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=976,format=webp/_astro/as-upstream-providers-timeseries.BUc6CJaT.png)

#### API endpoints

The data behind both widgets is also available through two new endpoints on the [`BGP`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/) API:

  * [`/bgp/routes/paths/{asn}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/subresources/routes/subresources/paths/methods/list/) — Returns the ordered AS path segments an AS uses to reach the Tier-1 networks, each with its observed path count, peer count, and contributing collectors, alongside the name and country of every ASN in the response. Pass `collector` to scope the result to a single RouteViews collector.
  * [`/bgp/routes/upstreams/{asn}/timeseries`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/subresources/routes/subresources/upstreams/methods/timeseries/) — Returns the share of an AS's observed paths carried by each direct upstream over time. Use `limit` to control how many upstreams come back as separate series before the rest are grouped into an `OTHER` series, and `ipVersion` to select the address family.



Visit the [AS13335 routing page ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as13335) to explore both widgets, or swap in any other AS number.

## [Precise IP location and richer AS details on the Cloudflare Radar IP page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-24-radar-ip-page-improvements/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now plots your IPv4 and IPv6 locations on the [IP page ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ip), shows the Cloudflare data centers serving your connection, and includes more detail about the autonomous system (AS) your primary IP belongs to.

#### Your IP location on the map

The map of your connection now shows:

  * **IP location markers** — The primary IP will show as a red marker. When both IP addresses do not geolocate to the same place, a second marker will appear in blue with a note explaining why IPv4 and IPv6 can resolve to different locations.
  * **Cloudflare data center markers** — Cloudflare data centers now show as orange dots on the map and the one you are connected to is highlighted.
  * **Data center connectors** — Each line connects your IP markers to their respective data centers.

![Map showing Cloudflare data centers and a marker representing the IP location with a line connected to a data center](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=3136,height=1305,format=webp/_astro/ip-page-geolocation.BJ53oUtj.png)

Due to the data policies of our geolocation provider, this detailed location is only available for your own IP. Other IP addresses keep the current country-level view.

#### Extended AS information

The AS card on the IP page now shows additional detail about the network an IP belongs to — including alternate names, the operator website, and an estimate of the AS user population — alongside the AS number and country.

## [Updated Workers AI popularity metric in Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-18-radar-workers-ai-inference-metric/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) has changed how it measures [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) model and task popularity.

Previously, popularity was based on the number of unique accounts running inferences against each model or task. It is now based on the **number of inferences** , giving a more representative view of actual usage volume. This change will affect all new measurements as well as historical data. As a result, the model and task distributions shown on Radar may differ from what you saw previously, and historical trends may shift accordingly.

The [Workers AI model popularity ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights#workers-ai-model-popularity) chart shows the distribution of inferences across models.

![Screenshot of the Workers AI model popularity chart on the AI Insights page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=938,format=webp/_astro/workers-ai-model-popularity.CMw_WVXg.png)

The [Workers AI task popularity ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights#workers-ai-task-popularity) chart shows the distribution of inferences across tasks.

![Screenshot of the Workers AI task popularity chart on the AI Insights page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=938,format=webp/_astro/workers-ai-task-popularity.ZoA-NO8k.png)

The same data is available via the following API endpoints:

  * [`/ai/inference/summary/{dimension}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/ai/subresources/inference/methods/summary_v2/)
  * [`/ai/inference/timeseries_groups/{dimension}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/ai/subresources/inference/methods/timeseries_groups_v2/)

## [Finer-grained chart granularity on Cloudflare Radar for longer time ranges](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-05-radar-traffic-chart-granularity/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now provides finer-grained traffic charts for longer time ranges. Previously, selecting a 1-3 month view on HTTP and NetFlows charts defaulted to weekly aggregation, which was too coarse to surface meaningful trends. Views longer than 3 months defaulted to monthly aggregation, returning as few as 7 data points for a 6-month range.

The new defaults are:

  * **1-3 months** : daily granularity (7x more data points)
  * **Longer than 3 months** (HTTP and NetFlows): weekly granularity (4x more data points)



For example, a 12-week traffic view previously showed weekly data:

![Traffic trends chart with weekly granularity for a 12-week view](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=878,format=webp/_astro/traffic-granularity-12w-before.OlJmS6Ts.png)

The same view now shows daily data:

![Traffic trends chart with daily granularity for a 12-week view](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=878,format=webp/_astro/traffic-granularity-12w-after.DL8mxwQ3.png)

Similarly, a 1-year HTTP traffic view that previously showed just 12 monthly data points now provides 52 weekly data points.

Visit [Cloudflare Radar ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/?dateRange=12w#traffic-trends) to explore the new granular views.

## [TLS bug detection in the Cloudflare Radar post-quantum checker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-29-radar-pq-tls-bug-detection/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

The [**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) [post-quantum TLS support checker ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/post-quantum#website-support) now also reports TLS bugs detected during the handshake test. When a scanned host exhibits compatibility issues, the results include details on the specific bugs detected, along with guidance on how to investigate and remediate each issue. The bugs section only appears for hosts where issues are found.

The following TLS bugs are detected:

  * **Split ClientHello** — The connection fails with a fragmented post-quantum `ClientHello` but succeeds with classical handshakes. Typically caused by middleboxes or firewalls that cannot reassemble split TLS messages.
  * **HRR Failure** — The server sends a `HelloRetryRequest` but fails to complete the handshake afterward.
  * **Unknown Keyshare** — The server cannot handle unknown key exchange algorithms and fails instead of responding with a `HelloRetryRequest` as required by the TLS 1.3 specification.

![TLS bug detection results in the Radar post-quantum checker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2260,height=1244,format=webp/_astro/pq-tls-bug-detection.BrmsVMno.png)

Bug detection data is available through the existing [`/post_quantum/tls/support`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/post_quantum/subresources/tls/methods/support/) endpoint.

Visit the [Post-Quantum Encryption ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/post-quantum#website-support) page to test a host.

## [Content type distribution and API traffic share on Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-20-radar-content-type-and-api-traffic/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now includes two new charts on the [traffic page ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic) that provide deeper insights into the composition of HTTP traffic: a content type distribution chart and an API traffic share chart.

#### Content type distribution

The new [**Content type** ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#content-type) chart displays the distribution of HTTP response content types, grouped into high-level categories. A traffic type selector allows filtering by human, bot, or all traffic. The existing [**Bot vs. Human** ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#bot-vs-human) chart also gained a content type category filter, allowing users to see the bot/human split for specific content categories.

![Screenshot of the content type distribution chart on the Radar traffic page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=878,format=webp/_astro/content-type-distribution.Dz2q1n6W.png)

Content type categories:

  * **HTML** — Web pages (`text/html`)
  * **Images** — All image formats (`image/*`)
  * **JSON** — JSON data and API responses (`application/json`, `*+json`)
  * **JavaScript** — Scripts (`application/javascript`, `text/javascript`)
  * **CSS** — Stylesheets (`text/css`)
  * **Plain Text** — Unformatted text (`text/plain`)
  * **Fonts** — Web fonts (`font/*`, `application/font-*`)
  * **XML** — XML documents and feeds (`text/xml`, `application/xml`, `application/rss+xml`, `application/atom+xml`)
  * **YAML** — Configuration files (`text/yaml`, `application/yaml`)
  * **Video** — Video content and streaming (`video/*`, `application/ogg`, `*mpegurl`)
  * **Audio** — Audio content (`audio/*`)
  * **Markdown** — Markdown documents (`text/markdown`)
  * **Documents** — PDFs, Office documents, ePub, CSV (`application/pdf`, `application/msword`, `text/csv`)
  * **Binary** — Executables, archives, WebAssembly (`application/octet-stream`, `application/zip`, `application/wasm`)
  * **Serialization** — Binary API formats (`application/protobuf`, `application/grpc`, `application/msgpack`)
  * **Other** — All other content types



The `CONTENT_TYPE` dimension and `contentType` filter are available on the HTTP [summary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/methods/summary_v2/), [timeseries groups](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/methods/timeseries_groups_v2/), and [timeseries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/methods/timeseries/) endpoints.

#### API traffic share

The new [**API traffic** ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#api-traffic) chart shows the percentage of dynamic (non-cacheable) HTTP request traffic that is API-related. API traffic is identified by JSON or XML response content types (`application/json`, `application/xml`, `text/xml`) on HTTP requests that returned a 200 status code. A traffic type selector allows switching between human traffic, bot traffic, or all traffic.

![Screenshot of the API traffic share chart on the Radar traffic page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=1006,format=webp/_astro/api-traffic-share._xl0TThn.png)

The `API_TRAFFIC` dimension is available on the existing HTTP [summary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/methods/summary_v2/) and [timeseries groups](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/methods/timeseries_groups_v2/) endpoints. An `apiTraffic` filter (`API` or `NON_API`) can also be applied to [HTTP timeseries](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/methods/timeseries/) requests to retrieve raw request counts for API-only or non-API traffic.

Visit the [Radar traffic page ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic) to explore these new charts.

## [MRT Explorer on Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-19-radar-mrt-explorer/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now includes an [MRT Explorer ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/mrt-explorer) tool in the Routing section. Route collectors like RIPE RIS and RouteViews publish MRT (Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit) dump files containing BGP announcements, withdrawals, and route attributes. The new tool parses these files entirely in the browser — nothing gets uploaded.

#### Loading a file

Paste a URL to fetch an MRT file remotely, drag and drop one onto the page, or browse for a local file. Gzip and bzip2 compressed files are supported. A sample file is also available to get started right away.

![Screenshot of the MRT Explorer file input form](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2428,height=898,format=webp/_astro/mrt-explorer-form.DKnzUqMC.png)

#### Inspecting events

Once parsed, the tool lists every BGP event with its timestamp, prefix, AS path, OTC (Only to Customer), and community attributes.

![Screenshot of the MRT Explorer event list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2410,height=1536,format=webp/_astro/mrt-explorer-list.8fq2u5Kc.png)

#### Event details

Clicking on the "View details" action opens a modal with additional properties and the full event JSON.

![Screenshot of the MRT Explorer event details modal](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1694,height=1890,format=webp/_astro/mrt-explorer-details.EMcHevWw.png)

#### Shareable URLs

When loading a file by URL, the query string captures the source so the link can be shared directly — the recipient's browser immediately fetches and parses the same file.

## [New routing widgets on Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-04-radar-routing-widgets/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) is expanding its [Routing section ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing) with two new widgets that give a deeper view into how networks announce address space and how RPKI ROA coverage evolves over time.

#### Top ASes by announced IP space on country pages

Country routing pages now include a **Top ASes by announced IP space** chart, breaking down the IPv4 and IPv6 address space announced from a country across the autonomous systems that originate it. The chart stacks the IPv4 and IPv6 views vertically, with the top contributing ASes called out by color and the remaining networks aggregated as **Other**.

![Screenshot of the top ASes by announced IP space chart on a country routing page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=1322,format=webp/_astro/country-top-ases-ip-space.CoGqJB6W.png)

#### RPKI ROA deployment timeseries

The [RPKI sub-page ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/rpki) adds an **RPKI ROA deployment** timeseries widget that tracks the share of announced BGP space covered by a valid Route Origin Authorization (ROA) over time, with separate IPv4 and IPv6 lines. A toggle switches the view between the share of covered **prefixes** and the share of covered **IP address space**. The widget is available on global, country, and AS views, so operators can monitor RPKI adoption progress and compare deployment trends across different scopes.

![Screenshot of the RPKI ROA deployment timeseries widget](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1600,height=874,format=webp/_astro/rpki-roa-deployment-timeseries.DTsP_V93.png)

#### API endpoints

The data behind these widgets is also available through two new endpoints on the [`BGP`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/) API:

  * [`/bgp/ips/top/ases`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/subresources/ips/subresources/top/methods/ases/) \- Returns the top autonomous systems by announced IP space (IPv4 `/24`s or IPv6 `/48`s), globally or filtered by country, snapped to the nearest 8-hour RIB boundary.
  * [`/bgp/rpki/roas/timeseries`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/bgp/subresources/rpki/subresources/roas/methods/timeseries/) \- Returns RPKI ROA validation coverage over time, by share of prefixes or share of IP address space, split by IP version, with optional ASN or location filters.

## [Cloud Services Observability in Cloudflare Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-11-24-radar-cloud-observability/)

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) introduces HTTP Origins insights, providing visibility into the status of traffic between Cloudflare's global network and cloud-based origin infrastructure.

The new [`Origins`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/) API provides provides the following endpoints:

  * [`/origins`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/list/) \- Lists all origins (cloud providers and associated regions).
  * [`/origins/{origin}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/get/) \- Retrieves information about a specific origin (cloud provider).
  * [`/origins/timeseries`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/timeseries/) \- Retrieves normalized time series data for a specific origin, including the following metrics: 
    * `REQUESTS`: Number of requests
    * `CONNECTION_FAILURES`: Number of connection failures
    * `RESPONSE_HEADER_RECEIVE_DURATION`: Duration of the response header receive
    * `TCP_HANDSHAKE_DURATION`: Duration of the TCP handshake
    * `TCP_RTT`: TCP round trip time
    * `TLS_HANDSHAKE_DURATION`: Duration of the TLS handshake
  * [`/origins/summary`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/summary/) \- Retrieves HTTP requests to origins summarized by a dimension.
  * [`/origins/timeseries_groups`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/origins/methods/timeseries_groups/) \- Retrieves timeseries data for HTTP requests to origins grouped by a dimension.



The following dimensions are available for the `summary` and `timeseries_groups` endpoints:

  * `region`: Origin region
  * `success_rate`: Success rate of requests (2XX versus 5XX response codes)
  * `percentile`: Percentiles of metrics listed above



Additionally, the [`Annotations`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/annotations/) and [`Traffic Anomalies`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/traffic_anomalies/) APIs have been extended to support origin outages and anomalies, enabling automated detection and alerting for origin infrastructure issues.
