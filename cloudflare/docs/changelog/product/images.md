## [View transformation analytics in Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-23-transformation-analytics/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

You can now view account-level analytics for your Images transformation usage.

Go to **Images & Stream** > **Transformations** > **Analytics** to view sampled estimates of image transformation request traffic, including:

  * Requests by source, split between URL-based transformations and Images binding transformations
  * Top zones, transformation configurations, and origin hosts for URL-based requests
  * Top Worker scripts for Images binding requests



Use these analytics to identify the zones, configurations, origins, and Workers generating the most image transformation requests.

## [New in Images: text rasterization and updates to the binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-02-images-binding-updates/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

We've added more ways to manage and manipulate images with the [Images binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/). Here's what's new:

**Render text into an image.** Output a string of text into its own image or draw it over another image.

  * Use the [`.text()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/#textcontent-options) method to rasterize text with the Images binding.
  * Style content using the `font`, `size`, and `color` options.
  * The [`draw`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/draw-overlays/#draw-with-cfimage) array in `cf.image` now accepts a `text` key.



**Manage hosted images without an API token.**

  * **Metadata filtering:** Pass `filter.metadata` to [`.list()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#listoptions) to return images by custom metadata. Match a bounded range by setting two operators in one condition, for example, `priority: { gte: 2, lte: 5 }`.
  * **Server-side signing:** Get a signed URL for a private image with [`.signedUrl()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#imageimageidsignedurloptions).
  * **User uploads:** Create a Direct Creator Upload link with [`.createDirectUpload()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#createdirectuploadoptions) so that a client can upload an image to your storage.



**Set headers in a single call.**

  * Pass a `headers` option to [`.response()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/#responseoptions) to set headers without rebuilding the `Response`.
  * `Content-Type` is always taken from the optimized image and can't be overridden by a specified header.
  * Set `Cache-Control` with [Workers Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cache/) to cache your optimized image at the edge.



For more information, refer to [Optimize with Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/), [Draw overlays and watermarks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/draw-overlays/), and [Manage hosted images with Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/).

## [Images binding is now billed per unique transformation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-07-01-binding-unique-transformations/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

The [Images binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/) is now billed per unique transformation, matching the model already used for URL-based transformations. Repeat requests for the same combination of source image and parameters within the same calendar month are counted only once.

Previously, every call to the binding counted as a separate transformation regardless of whether the image or parameters were unique. With this change, you can call the binding on hot paths without paying for each individual request.

Calls to [`.info()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/#infostream) are no longer billed.

For more information, refer to [Images pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/pricing/#images-transformed) and the [Images binding documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/).

## [New optimization features in Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-16-new-optimization-features/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

These updates introduce new features for optimizing and manipulating with Images:

  * **New`composite` option:** Control how [overlays are blended](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/draw-overlays/#composite) with the base image.
  * **Percentage widths:** Set the dimensions of an overlay as [a fraction of the dimensions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/draw-overlays/#width-and-height) of the base image.
  * **New`fit` modes:** Use [`aspect-crop`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/features/#aspect-crop) to always preserve the target aspect ratio or [`scale-up`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/features/#scale-up) to always enlarge images.
  * **New`upscale` parameter:** Apply [AI upscaling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/features/#upscale) to produce sharper, more detailed results when enlarging images.

## [Manage hosted images with the Images binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-10-hosted-images-binding/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

Use the Images binding to upload, list, retrieve, update, and delete images stored in Images directly from your Worker without managing API tokens or making HTTP requests.

The `env.IMAGES.hosted` namespace supports the following storage and management operations:

  * [`.upload(image, options)`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#uploadimage-options) — Upload a new image to your account.
  * [`.list(options)`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#listoptions) — List images with pagination.
  * [`.image(imageId).details()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#imageimageiddetails) — Get image metadata.
  * [`.image(imageId).bytes()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#imageimageidbytes) — Stream the original image bytes.
  * [`.image(imageId).update(options)`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#imageimageidupdateoptions) — Update metadata or access controls.
  * [`.image(imageId).delete()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/#imageimageiddelete) — Delete an image.



For example, you can upload an image from a request body and return its metadata:
    
    
    const image = await env.IMAGES.hosted.upload(request.body, {
    	filename: "upload.jpg",
    	metadata: { source: "worker" },
    });
    
    return Response.json(image);

Or retrieve and serve the original bytes of a hosted image:
    
    
    const bytes = await env.IMAGES.hosted.image("IMAGE_ID").bytes();
    return new Response(bytes);

For more information, refer to the [Images binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/binding/).

## [Transformation flows in Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-27-transformation-flows/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

![Custom flow configuration panel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1654,height=1398,format=webp/_astro/custom-flow.DeAGR8BY.png)

Flows are automated rules that pair conditions (such as file extension, URL path, or query parameter) with parameters. Set up a flow to automatically apply image optimization to matching requests on your zone without writing code or changing URLs.

There are two modes for transformation flows:

  * **[Provider flows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/flows/#set-up-a-provider-flow)** — Migrate from another image optimization service. Your existing URLs continue to work while Cloudflare rewrites provider-specific parameters to their Cloudflare equivalents. Currently, Cloudflare supports provider flows for Fastly Image Optimizer.
  * **[Custom flows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/flows/#set-up-a-custom-flow)** — Define your own conditions and actions for use cases like automatic format conversion, [responsive sizing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/make-responsive-images/#using-widthauto) with `width=auto`, or directory-based optimization.



To get started, go to **Images** > **Transformations** > **Automation** in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/transformations).

Learn more about [transformation flows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/flows/).

## [HEIC support in Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/heic-support/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

You can use Images to ingest HEIC images and serve them in supported output formats like AVIF, WebP, JPEG, and PNG.

When inputting a HEIC image, dimension and sizing limits may still apply. Refer to our documentation to see limits for [uploading to Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/storage/upload-images/methods/) or [transforming a remote image](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/overview/).

## [Bind the Images API to your Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-02-21-images-bindings-in-workers/)

[Cloudflare Images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/)

You can now [interact with the Images API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/) directly in your Worker.

This allows more fine-grained control over transformation request flows and cache behavior. For example, you can resize, manipulate, and overlay images without requiring them to be accessible through a URL.

The Images binding can be configured in the Cloudflare dashboard for your Worker or in the Wrangler configuration file in your project's directory:
    
    
    {
    	"images": {
    		"binding": "IMAGES", // i.e. available in your Worker on env.IMAGES
    	},
    }
    
    
    [images]
    binding = "IMAGES"

Within your Worker code, you can interact with this binding by using `env.IMAGES`.

Here's how you can rotate, resize, and blur an image, then output the image as AVIF:
    
    
    const info = await env.IMAGES.info(stream);
    // stream contains a valid image, and width/height is available on the info object
    
    const response = (
    	await env.IMAGES.input(stream)
    		.transform({ rotate: 90 })
    		.transform({ width: 128 })
    		.transform({ blur: 20 })
    		.output({ format: "image/avif" })
    ).response();
    
    return response;

For more information, refer to [Images Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/).
