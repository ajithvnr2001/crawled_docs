## [Artifacts is now in open beta](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-01-artifacts-open-beta/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/), Cloudflare's versioned file system that speaks Git, is now in open beta. Artifacts is built for scale, so you can create a repository per project, user, session, or task.

With Artifacts, you can:

  * **Deploy repositories to Workers** — Connect an Artifacts repository through [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/artifacts-integration/). Pushes to the production branch deploy the updated Worker, while other branches create or update [Worker Previews](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/).
  * **Programmatically manage repositories** — Use an [Artifacts binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/workers-binding/) from a Worker to create or fork repos, inspect files and commits, read files by path, and issue repo-scoped Git tokens.
  * **React to repository changes** — [Subscribe to events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/event-subscriptions/) when a repository is created, imported, forked, deleted, pushed to, cloned, or fetched.
  * **Control where repository data is stored** — Choose to [store and process](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/data-localization/) your data in the US or EU.
  * **Monitor repository usage** — View total operations, pulls, pushes, errors, and error rates in the Cloudflare dashboard or [via API for analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/observability/metrics/).



Artifacts is available for customers on the Workers Paid plan. Cloudflare will begin [billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/platform/pricing/) for Artifacts on October 14, 2026.

#### Build the next GitHub on Cloudflare

We are hosting a competition to see who can build the next GitHub on Cloudflare using Workers and Artifacts.

[Apply today ↗︎](https://www.cloudflare.com/git-competition/) — submissions are open until October 14, 2026.

The first-place team will receive $25,000 in Cloudflare credits. The top three teams will be flown to San Francisco to present what they built at Cloudflare Connect.

Get started with the [Artifacts documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/).

## [Data localization support for Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-13-artifacts-jurisdictions/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)

Artifacts now supports jurisdictions, allowing you to select the European Union or the United States as the only location where repo data is stored and processed.

Select a jurisdiction when you create a namespace. Every repo in that namespace automatically uses the selected jurisdiction.
    
    
    curl --request POST \
      "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/artifacts/namespaces" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "namespace": "my-eu-namespace",
        "jurisdiction": "eu"
      }'

Jurisdictions cannot be changed after namespace creation. If you omit the jurisdiction, Artifacts creates an unrestricted namespace.

For supported jurisdictions and usage details, refer to [Data localization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/data-localization/).

## [Build and deploy Artifacts repos on every push](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-04-build-and-deploy-on-push/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)

You can now run your CI/CD pipeline on your [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/) repo by defining a CI [Workflow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) with the [CI SDK ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/ci), automatically triggered on Artifacts push events.

This allows you to:

  * Automatically build and deploy application code stored in Artifacts.
  * Run linting, type checking, tests, and other checks on every push.
  * Reuse dependencies when the lockfile (i.e. `pnpm-lock.yaml`) has not changed.
  * Stop deployment when a check or build fails.
  * Restrict API token access to the deployment step.
  * Deploy the output to a [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or a [Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) User Worker.



Define your CI steps with `@cloudflare/ci`. Each `ci.runner()` spins up an isolated sandbox, and the `cache` option reuses installed dependencies across each sandboxed step in your CI job.

Point `cache.inputs` at your lockfile (i.e. `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`), and the install step only runs again when that lockfile changes:

src/index.jsjs
    
    
    const deps = await ci.runner({
    	name: "install",
    	command: "bun install --frozen-lockfile",
    	cache: { inputs: ["package.json", "bun.lock"] },
    });
    
    await Promise.all([
    	deps.runner({ name: "lint", command: "bun run lint" }),
    	deps.runner({ name: "test", command: "bun run test" }),
    	deps.runner({ name: "typecheck", command: "bun run typecheck" }),
    	deps.runner({ name: "build", command: "bun run build" }),
    ]);
    
    await deps.runner({ name: "deploy", command: "bun wrangler deploy" });

src/index.tsts
    
    
    const deps = await ci.runner({
    	name: "install",
    	command: "bun install --frozen-lockfile",
    	cache: { inputs: ["package.json", "bun.lock"] },
    });
    
    await Promise.all([
    	deps.runner({ name: "lint", command: "bun run lint" }),
    	deps.runner({ name: "test", command: "bun run test" }),
    	deps.runner({ name: "typecheck", command: "bun run typecheck" }),
    	deps.runner({ name: "build", command: "bun run build" }),
    ]);
    
    await deps.runner({ name: "deploy", command: "bun wrangler deploy" });

To start the Workflow automatically after each push, add a `cf.artifacts.repo.pushed` trigger to your Wrangler configuration:
    
    
    {
    	"triggers": {
    		"events": [
    			{
    				"type": "cf.artifacts.repo.pushed",
    				"filter": {
    					"namespace": "CI",
    					"repoName": "my-repo",
    				},
    				"target": {
    					"scriptName": "my-ci-worker",
    					"workflowName": "ci-workflow",
    				},
    			},
    		],
    	},
    }
    
    
    [[triggers.events]]
    type = "cf.artifacts.repo.pushed"
    
      [triggers.events.filter]
      namespace = "CI"
      repoName = "my-repo"
    
      [triggers.events.target]
      scriptName = "my-ci-worker"
      workflowName = "ci-workflow"

## [Manage Artifacts from the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-06-17-dashboard-management/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)

You can now configure [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/how-artifacts-works/) namespaces, repos, and tokens directly from the Cloudflare dashboard.

Artifacts is Git-compatible storage that lets you store repos on Cloudflare and interact with them using standard Git workflows.

You can view and create [namespaces](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/namespaces/#use-namespaces-as-containers), which are top-level containers for repos:

![Artifacts namespaces dashboard showing namespace search and create namespace controls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1804,height=598,format=webp/_astro/dashboard-namespaces.0BJelWZh.png)

You can view, create, fork, and search repos within a namespace:

![Artifacts repositories dashboard showing repo source, access, and created columns](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1874,height=592,format=webp/_astro/dashboard-repositories.M9P9JUL_.png)

You can open a repo to view its files and copy its Git remote URL.

![Artifacts repository overview showing files, commits, token management, and quick actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2194,height=806,format=webp/_astro/dashboard-repo-overview.CSHxrCW2.png)

You can also provision tokens directly from the dashboard to scope Git access to a single repo, with read tokens for clone, fetch, and pull workflows, or write tokens when a client needs to push changes.

To get started, go to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select **Storage & databases** > **Artifacts**.

If you are enrolled in the Artifacts beta, you can use the dashboard to set up Artifacts. If you would like to join the beta, complete the [request form ↗︎](https://forms.gle/DwBoPRa3CWQ8ajFp7).

## [Event subscriptions for Artifacts lifecycle events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-19-event-subscriptions/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)[Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/)

You can now receive [event notifications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/event-subscriptions/) for [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/) repository changes and consume them from a Worker to build commit-driven automation.

This allows you to:

  * Run custom workflows when a repository is created or imported
  * Kick off a build and deploy a change when an agent pushes to a repo
  * Trigger a review agent on every push



Available events include:

  * **Account-level events** (`artifacts` source) — `repo.created`, `repo.deleted`, `repo.forked`, `repo.imported`
  * **Repository-level events** (`artifacts.repo` source) — `pushed`, `cloned`, `fetched`



To learn more, refer to [Artifacts documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/event-subscriptions/).

## [Manage Artifacts namespaces and repos with Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-05-18-wrangler-support/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)

You can now manage [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/) namespaces, repos, and repo-scoped tokens directly from Wrangler CLI.

Available commands:

  * `wrangler artifacts namespaces list` — List Artifacts namespaces in your account.
  * `wrangler artifacts namespaces get` — Get metadata for a namespace.
  * `wrangler artifacts repos create` — Create a repo in a namespace.
  * `wrangler artifacts repos list` — List repos in a namespace.
  * `wrangler artifacts repos get` — Get metadata for a repo.
  * `wrangler artifacts repos delete` — Delete a repo.
  * `wrangler artifacts repos issue-token` — Issue a repo-scoped token for Git access.



To get started, refer to the [Wrangler Artifacts commands documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/artifacts/).

## [Artifacts now in beta: versioned filesystem with Git access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-04-16-artifacts-now-in-beta/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/) is now in private beta. Artifacts is Git-compatible storage built for scale: create tens of millions of repos, fork from any remote, and hand off a URL to any Git client. It provides a versioned filesystem for storing and exchanging file trees across Workers, the REST API, and any Git client, running locally or within an agent.

You can [read the announcement blog ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/artifacts-git-for-agents-beta/) to learn more about what Artifacts does, how it works, and how to create repositories for your agents to use.

Artifacts has three API surfaces:

  * Workers bindings (for creating and managing repositories)
  * REST API (for creating and managing repos from any other compute platform)
  * Git protocol (for interacting with repos)



As an example: you can use the Workers binding to create a repo and read back its remote URL:
    
    
    # Create a thousand, a million or ten million repos: one for every agent, for every upstream branch, or every user.
    const created = await env.PROD_ARTIFACTS.create("agent-007");
    const remote = (await created.repo.info())?.remote;

Or, use the REST API to create a repo inside a namespace from your agent(s) running on any platform:
    
    
    curl --request POST "https://artifacts.cloudflare.net/v1/api/namespaces/some-namespace/repos" --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"name":"agent-007"}'

Any Git client that speaks smart HTTP can use the returned remote URL:
    
    
    # Agents know git.
    # Every repository can act as a git repo, allowing agents to interact with Artifacts the way they know best: using the git CLI.
    git clone https://x:${REPO_TOKEN}@artifacts.cloudflare.net/some-namespace/agent-007.git

To learn more, refer to [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/get-started/), [Workers binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/workers-binding/), and [Git protocol](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/git-protocol/).
