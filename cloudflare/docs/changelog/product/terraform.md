## [Automate migration from Cloudflare's Terraform v4 to v5 provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-04-24-tf-migrate-tool-released/)

[Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)

We're excited to announce **tf-migrate** , a purpose-built CLI tool that simplifies migrating from Cloudflare Terraform Provider v4 to v5.

#### v5 is stable and ready for production

**Terraform Provider v5 is stable and actively receiving updates.** We encourage all users to migrate to v5 to take advantage of ongoing enhancements and new capabilities.

Cloudflare uses tf-migrate to migrate our own infrastructure — the same tool we're providing to the community — ensuring the best possible migration experience.

#### What tf-migrate does

**tf-migrate** automates the tedious and error-prone parts of the v4 to v5 migration process:

  * **Resource type renames** – Automatically updates `cloudflare_record` → `cloudflare_dns_record`, `cloudflare_access_application` → `cloudflare_zero_trust_access_application`, and 40+ other renamed resources
  * **Attribute transformations** – Updates field names (e.g., `value` → `content` for DNS records) and restructures nested blocks
  * **Moved block generation** – Creates Terraform 1.8+ `moved` blocks to prevent resource replacements and ensure zero-downtime migrations
  * **Cross-file reference updates** – Automatically finds and updates all references to renamed resources across your entire configuration
  * **Dry-run mode** – Preview all changes before applying them to ensure safety



Combined with the automatic state upgraders introduced in v5.19+, tf-migrate eliminates the manual work and risk that previously made v5 migrations challenging. Tf-migrate operates directly on the config, and the built-in state upgraders handle the rest.

#### Supported resources

Tf-migrate currently supports the most common Terraform resources our customers use. We are actively working to expand coverage, with the most commonly used resources prioritized first.

For the complete list of supported resources and their migration status, refer to the [v5 Stabilization Tracker ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/6237). This list is updated regularly as additional resources are stabilized and migration support is added.

Resources not yet supported by tf-migrate will need to be migrated manually using the [version 5 upgrade guide ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade). The upgrade guide provides step-by-step instructions for handling resource renames, attribute changes, and state migrations.

#### Get started

  * [Download tf-migrate ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/tf-migrate/releases)
  * [Version 5 Migration Guide ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-migration)
  * [Terraform Provider documentation ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)
  * [v5 Stabilization Tracker ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/6237)



We have been releasing Betas over the past month and a half while testing this tool. See the full changelog of those Betas here: [tf-migrate releases ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/tf-migrate/releases).

#### Upgrade to newer version

We suggest waiting to migrate to v5 while we work on stabilization. This helps with avoiding any blocking issues while the Terraform resources are actively being [stabilized ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/6237). We will be releasing a new migration tool in March 2026 to help support v4 to v5 transitions for our most popular resources.

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)

Earlier this year, we announced the launch of the new Terraform v5 Provider. We are aware of the high number of issues reported by the Cloudflare community related to the v5 release. We have committed to releasing improvements on a [2-3 week cadence ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/5774) to ensure its stability and reliability, including the v5.14 release. We have also pivoted from an [issue-to-issue approach to a resource-per-resource approach ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues/6237) \- we will be focusing on specific resources to not only stabilize the resource but also ensure it is migration-friendly for those migrating from v4 to v5.

## [Terraform v5.9 now available](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-08-29-terrform-v5.9-provider/)

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)

Earlier this year, we announced the launch of the new [Terraform v5 Provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-02-03-terraform-v5-provider/). We are aware of the high number of [issues ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare) reported by the Cloudflare community related to the v5 release. We have committed to releasing improvements on a 2 week cadence to ensure its stability and reliability, including the v5.9 release. We have also pivoted from an issue-to-issue approach to a resource-per-resource approach - we will be focusing on specific resources for every release, stabilizing the release, and closing all associated bugs with that resource before moving onto resolving migration issues.

Thank you for continuing to raise issues. We triage them weekly and they help make our products stronger.

This release includes a new resource, `cloudflare_snippet`, which replaces `cloudflare_snippets`. `cloudflare_snippet` is now considered deprecated but can still be used. Please utilize `cloudflare_snippet` as soon as possible.

#### Changes

  * Resources stabilized: 
    * `cloudflare_zone_setting`
    * `cloudflare_worker_script`
    * `cloudflare_worker_route`
    * `tiered_cache`
  * **NEW** resource `cloudflare_snippet` which should be used in place of `cloudflare_snippets`. `cloudflare_snippets` is now deprecated. This enables the management of Cloudflare's snippet functionality through Terraform.
  * DNS Record Improvements: Enhanced handling of DNS record drift detection
  * Load Balancer Fixes: Resolved `created_on` field inconsistencies and improved pool configuration handling
  * Bot Management: Enhanced auto-update model state consistency and fight mode configurations
  * Other bug fixes

If you have an unaddressed issue with the provider, we encourage you to check the [open issues ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues) and open a new issue if one does not already exist for what you are experiencing.

#### Upgrading

We suggest holding off on migration to v5 while we work on stabilization. This help will you avoid any blocking issues while the Terraform resources are actively being stabilized.

If you'd like more information on migrating from v4 to v5, please make use of the [migration guide ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade). We have provided automated migration scripts using Grit which simplify the transition. These do not support implementations which use Terraform modules, so customers making use of modules need to migrate manually. Please make use of `terraform plan` to test your changes before applying, and let us know if you encounter any additional issues by reporting to our [GitHub repository ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare).

If you have an unaddressed issue with the provider, we encourage you to check the [open issues ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare/issues) and open a new one if one does not already exist for what you are experiencing.

#### Upgrading

We suggest holding off on migration to v5 while we work on stabilization. This help will you avoid any blocking issues while the Terraform resources are actively being stabilized.

If you'd like more information on migrating from v4 to v5, please make use of the [migration guide ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade). We have provided automated migration scripts using Grit which simplify the transition, although these do not support implementations which use Terraform modules, so customers making use of modules need to migrate manually. Please make use of `terraform plan` to test your changes before applying, and let us know if you encounter any additional issues by reporting to our [GitHub repository ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare).

## [Dozens of Cloudflare Terraform Provider resources now have proper drift detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-03-21-resource-force-replacement-bug/)

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)

In [Cloudflare Terraform Provider ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare) versions 5.2.0 and above, dozens of resources now have proper drift detection. Before this fix, these resources would indicate they needed to be updated or replaced — even if there was no real change. Now, you can rely on your `terraform plan` to only show what resources are expected to change.

This issue affected [resources ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) related to these products and features:

  * API Shield
  * Argo Smart Routing
  * Argo Tiered Caching
  * Bot Management
  * BYOIP
  * D1
  * DNS
  * Email Routing
  * Hyperdrive
  * Observatory
  * Pages
  * R2
  * Rules
  * SSL/TLS
  * Waiting Room
  * Workers

## [Cloudflare Terraform Provider now properly redacts sensitive values](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-03-21-sensitive-values-redacted/)

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)

In the [Cloudflare Terraform Provider ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/terraform-provider-cloudflare) versions 5.2.0 and above, sensitive properties of resources are redacted in logs. Sensitive properties in [Cloudflare's OpenAPI Schema ↗︎](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudflare/api-schemas/refs/heads/main/openapi.yaml) are now annotated with `x-sensitive: true`. This results in proper auto-generation of the corresponding Terraform resources, and prevents sensitive values from being shown when you run Terraform commands.

This issue affected [resources ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs) related to these products and features:

  * Alerts and Audit Logs
  * Device API
  * DLP
  * DNS
  * Magic Visibility
  * Magic WAN
  * TLS Certs and Hostnames
  * Tunnels
  * Turnstile
  * Workers

## [Terraform v5 Provider is now generally available](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-02-03-terraform-v5-provider/)

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/)

![Screenshot of Terraform defining a Zone](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1330,height=296,format=webp/_astro/2024-02-03-terraform-v5-screenshot.mW8OaFoS.png)

Cloudflare's v5 Terraform Provider is now generally available. With this release, Terraform resources are now automatically generated based on OpenAPI Schemas. This change brings alignment across our SDKs, API documentation, and now Terraform Provider. The new provider boosts coverage by increasing support for API properties to 100%, adding 25% more resources, and more than 200 additional data sources. Going forward, this will also reduce the barriers to bringing more resources into Terraform across the broader Cloudflare API. This is a small, but important step to making more of our platform manageable through GitOps, making it easier for you to manage Cloudflare just like you do your other infrastructure.

The Cloudflare Terraform Provider v5 is a ground-up rewrite of the provider and introduces breaking changes for some resource types. Please refer to the [upgrade guide ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/guides/version-5-upgrade) for best practices, or the [blog post on automatically generating Cloudflare's Terraform Provider ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-generating-cloudflares-terraform-provider/) for more information about the approach.
