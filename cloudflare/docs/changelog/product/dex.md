## [Wi-Fi signal and network performance analytics for Cloudflare One Client devices](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-07-09-warp-wifi-network-performance-analytics/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into device, network, and application performance across your Cloudflare SASE deployment.

The **Device Monitoring** page now analyzes hardware and network data between a Cloudflare One Client device and Cloudflare's edge, so you can diagnose connectivity and performance issues. Previously, this data was only available in raw DEX Device State Event logs, which required you to build your own analytics to interpret it.

![Device Monitoring summary with connection status, connection mode, Wi-Fi signal strength, traffic performance, and device health](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1652,height=664,format=webp/_astro/dex-device-monitoring-summary.CBxeSd6b.png)

A summary at the top of the page shows the health of each category at a glance, using **Good** , **Fair** , and **Poor** labels:

  * **Connection** — connection status, Cloudflare One Client mode, and tunnel type over time
  * **Wi-Fi signal strength** — signal measured in dBm over time, with thresholds that flag a weak signal
  * **Traffic performance** — upstream and downstream performance, including network throughput on the active interface
  * **Device health** — hardware metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk

![Wi-Fi signal strength and network throughput charts on the Device Monitoring page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1666,height=732,format=webp/_astro/dex-device-monitoring-wifi-network.CoEBznAm.png)

You can filter by category and adjust the time range to correlate a device's metrics with a user's reported issue.

These analytics are available to all Cloudflare One customers at no additional cost.

To learn more, refer to the [DEX monitoring documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/monitoring/).

## [DEX Supports EU Customer Metadata Boundary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-02-19-dex-supports-cmb-eu/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into [WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/) device connectivity and performance to any internal or external application.

Now, all DEX logs are fully compatible with Cloudflare's [Customer Metadata Boundary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/metadata-boundary/) (CMB) setting for the 'EU' (European Union), which ensures that DEX logs will not be stored outside the 'EU' when the option is configured.

If a Cloudflare One customer using DEX enables CMB 'EU', they will not see any DEX data in the Cloudflare One dashboard. Customers can ingest DEX data via [LogPush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/), and build their own analytics and dashboards.

If a customer enables CMB in their account, they will see the following message in the Digital Experience dashboard: "DEX data is unavailable because Customer Metadata Boundary configuration is on. Use Cloudflare LogPush to export DEX datasets."

![Digital Experience Monitoring message when Customer Metadata Boundary for the EU is enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2143,height=1221,format=webp/_astro/dex_supports_cmb.6YOLXjHN.png)

## [DEX Logpush jobs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-11-12-dex-logpush-jobs/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into WARP device metrics, connectivity, and network performance across your Cloudflare SASE deployment.

We've released four new WARP and DEX device data sets that can be exported via [Cloudflare Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/). These Logpush data sets can be exported to R2, a cloud bucket, or a SIEM to build a customized logging and analytics experience.

  1. [DEX Application Tests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dex_application_tests/)
  2. [DEX Device State Events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/dex_device_state_events/)
  3. [WARP Config Changes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/warp_config_changes/)
  4. [WARP Toggle Changes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/warp_toggle_changes/)



To create a new DEX or WARP Logpush job, customers can go to the account level of the Cloudflare dashboard > Analytics & Logs > Logpush to get started.

## [DEX MCP Server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-08-29-dex-mcp-server/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into device connectivity and performance across your Cloudflare SASE deployment.

We've released an MCP server [(Model Context Protocol) ↗︎](https://cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/) for DEX.

The DEX MCP server is an AI tool that allows customers to ask a question like, "Show me the connectivity and performance metrics for the device used by carly‌@acme.com", and receive an answer that contains data from the DEX API.

Any Cloudflare One customer using a Free, Pay-as-you-go, or Enterprise account can access the DEX MCP Server. This feature is available to everyone.

Customers can test the new DEX MCP server in less than one minute. To learn more, read the [DEX MCP server documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/dex-mcp-server/).

## [Cloudflare One Agent now supports Endpoint Monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-03-07-cloudflare-one-device-health-monitoring/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/)

[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into device, network, and application performance across your Cloudflare SASE deployment. The latest release of the Cloudflare One agent (v2025.1.861) now includes device endpoint monitoring capabilities to provide deeper visibility into end-user device performance which can be analyzed directly from the dashboard.

Device health metrics are now automatically collected, allowing administrators to:

  * View the last network a user was connected to
  * Monitor CPU and RAM utilization on devices
  * Identify resource-intensive processes running on endpoints

![Device endpoint monitoring dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1226,height=675,format=webp/_astro/cloudflare-one-agent-health-monitoring.XXtiRuOp.gif)

This feature complements existing DEX features like [synthetic application monitoring](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/) and [network path visualization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/tests/traceroute/), creating a comprehensive troubleshooting workflow that connects application performance with device state.
