## [Test Cron Triggers with Local Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-17-local-explorer-cron-triggers/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/)

Local Explorer can now send one-off Cron Trigger invocations to a Worker's `scheduled()` handler during local development. This removes the need to construct request URLs when testing handler behavior.

Start your local development server with [`cf dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/projects/#start-development), [`wrangler dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#dev), or the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/). Open `/cdn-cgi/local/explorer` on the server URL and select **Cron Triggers**.

The browser interface supports the following tasks:

  * Invoke configured cron expressions
  * Build ad hoc expressions
  * Set reusable scheduled times
  * Inspect outcomes and `noRetry()` status



Ad hoc triggers and scheduled time presets stay in your browser. They do not change `cloudflare.config.ts`, your Wrangler configuration, or deployed Cron Triggers. Local development does not run cron schedules automatically.

Full logs and traces are available in the development session that owns the Worker when that session has **Observability** turned on.

The following example uses port `8787`. Replace it with your development server port, such as `5173` for Vite.

The Local Explorer API exposes the same operation for tools and AI agents. The request targets an exact Worker name and accepts a cron expression and optional scheduled time:
    
    
    curl -X POST \
      "http://localhost:8787/cdn-cgi/local/explorer/api/local/scheduled?worker=my-worker" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"cron":"0 * * * *","scheduled_time":1745856238000}'

For more details, refer to [Test Cron Triggers with Local Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/local-explorer/#test-cron-triggers).

## [Search Cloudflare documentation with the Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-16-docs-search/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/)

Cloudflare CLI `1.0.0-beta.16` includes `cf docs search`, so you and your coding agent can find Cloudflare documentation without leaving the terminal. Search for guides, tutorials, and examples across Cloudflare products.

To install or update to the latest release:

npmyarnpnpmbun
    
    
    npm install --global cf@latest
    
    
    yarn global add cf@latest
    
    
    pnpm add --global cf@latest
    
    
    bun add --global cf@latest

Describe what you want to do, or ask a question:
    
    
    cf docs search "proxy a DNS record"
    cf docs search "rate limit requests with WAF"
    cf docs search "schedule a worker"

The command searches live Cloudflare documentation and returns up to five ranked JSON results. Each result includes a title, description, and documentation URL. An Internet connection is required.

![Terminal demo of Cloudflare CLI beta-16 searching DNS and WAF documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1280,height=720,format=webp/_astro/docs-search-demo.cWBK3YBx.gif)

Agents can parse the results and fetch a complete page as Markdown. For example, use `jq` to select the first result, then request its URL with the `Accept: text/markdown` header:
    
    
    url=$(cf docs search "proxy a DNS record" | jq -r '.[0].url')
    curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" "$url"

This release also standardizes generated command names to kebab-case. For example, `cf accounts billing getCredits` becomes `cf accounts billing get-credits`. For the full list of breaking command and flag changes, refer to the [Cloudflare CLI release notes ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cf/blob/main/packages/cli/CHANGELOG.md).

## [Gateway and Workers integration is now in public beta](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-15-gateway-workers-public-beta/)

[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

Cloudflare Gateway now integrates with Cloudflare Workers in public beta on all Zero Trust plans. You can use the **Forward** action in [Gateway HTTP policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/) to run your own code on matching, permitted traffic without managing a separate proxy.

The **Forward** action lets you transform HTTP requests and responses, return a coaching page, or run background tasks such as Slack notifications and R2 captures. Your Worker receives the request and [Gateway context](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/integrate-workers/available-context/), including connection metadata, user identity, and device posture when available.

![A matching Gateway Forward policy sends HTTP traffic to a Worker, which processes requests and responses for Internet or private-network upstream services.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2048,height=1053,format=webp/_astro/gateway-workers-forward.CFUFJAE0.png)

Gateway handles the proxy connection, TLS decryption, and upstream routing. It evaluates HTTP request policies before Forward policies and inspects the final response before returning it to the user.

Gateway inspects the original request body before delivering it to your Worker. A body-inspection Block decision can interrupt the Worker.

To get started, [deploy a Worker and configure a Forward policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/integrate-workers/forward-traffic/), or adapt one of the [Worker templates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/integrate-workers/worker-templates/).

## [Workers Builds now uses newer versions of Node.js, Python, Go, Bun, and more](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-14-workers-builds-default-tooling/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Your builds now run on newer versions of Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Bun, Yarn, and Python package managers by default, so you get the latest fixes and features without changing your build configuration.

#### Runtimes

Runtime | Previous version | New version | Override with  
---|---|---|---  
Node.js | 24.18.0 | 24.21.0 | `NODE_VERSION`  
Python | 3.13.3 | 3.14.8 | `PYTHON_VERSION`  
Ruby | 3.4.7 | 3.4.11 | `RUBY_VERSION`  
Go | 1.24.3 | 1.27.2 | `GO_VERSION`  
  
#### Tools and package managers

Tool | Previous version | New version | Override with  
---|---|---|---  
Bun | 1.2.15 | 1.4.3 | `BUN_VERSION`  
Yarn | 4.9.1 | 4.18.1 | `YARN_VERSION`  
pip | 25.1.1 | 26.2.1 |   
pipx | 1.7.1 | 1.17.2 |   
Poetry | 2.1.3 | 2.4.3 |   
uv | 0.7.13 | 0.12.10 |   
  
Bun 1.4.3 supports both v1 (`bun.lockb`) and v2 (`bun.lock`) lockfiles, so existing Bun projects continue to install without changes.

If your project already sets a version through an environment variable or a version file (such as `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `.python-version`, or `.ruby-version`), your builds continue to use that version. To keep using a previous default, add the matching environment variable to your build configuration. For example, set `PYTHON_VERSION` to `3.13.3`.

For more information, refer to [Override default versions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-image/#overriding-default-versions) and the [build image policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-image/#build-image-policy).

## [Cloudflare API MCP server sends Workers Issues as MCP Events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-13-cloudflare-mcp-events/)

[Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Workers Issues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/issues/) provides built-in error monitoring for Cloudflare Workers. It detects production failures and groups related failures into issues without an SDK or application wrapper.

The [Cloudflare API MCP server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/#cloudflare-api-mcp-server) now sends these issues as [MCP Events ↗︎](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-triggers-events), the first event it exposes. MCP clients discover `cloudflare.alert.workers_observability_real_time_issue` with `events/list` and subscribe with `events/subscribe`, scoped to an account or a single Worker. When Issues detects a new or recurring issue, the server posts a signed event to the client's webhook, so an agent can start investigating without polling.

To use it, [enable Issues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/issues/#enable-issues) on your Worker and connect `https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp` with the Notifications Write and Workers Observability Write permissions to a client that supports MCP Events webhooks.

## [Run OpenCode 2.0 on Cloudflare with the Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-12-opencode-harness/)

[Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

The [Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) now supports [OpenCode 2.0 ↗︎](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/build/sdk/) through the experimental `OpenCodeHarness`. Run OpenCode inside a plain Durable Object, with sessions stored in SQLite and Lifecycle jobs that wake interrupted work after eviction.

The `agents/models/opencode` provider connects OpenCode to Workers AI through the `AI` binding. OpenCode plugins extend the harness with custom tools, remote MCP servers, and skills. Refer to [OpenCode's Cloudflare SDK documentation ↗︎](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/build/sdk/cloudflare/) for the embedded host API.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/next/harnesses/opencode)

Install Agents SDK 0.28.0 or later with the OpenCode packages:

npmyarnpnpmbun
    
    
    npm i agents@latest @opencode/sdk@2 @opencode/plugin@2
    
    
    yarn add agents@latest @opencode/sdk@2 @opencode/plugin@2
    
    
    pnpm add agents@latest @opencode/sdk@2 @opencode/plugin@2
    
    
    bun add agents@latest @opencode/sdk@2 @opencode/plugin@2

Create a harness and install a Lifecycle on your Durable Object:
    
    
    import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";
    import { Lifecycle } from "agents/lifecycle";
    import { OpenCodeWorkerd } from "@opencode/sdk/workerd";
    import { OpenCodeHarness } from "agents/harness/opencode";
    import { createAI } from "agents/models/opencode";
    import workerTools from "./worker-tools";
    
    export class Assistant extends DurableObject {
    	ai = createAI({ binding: this.env.AI });
    	harness = new OpenCodeHarness({
    		opencode: ({ storage }) =>
    			OpenCodeWorkerd.create({
    				storage,
    				models: { fetch: false },
    				plugins: [this.ai.plugin, workerTools],
    			}),
    		defaults: {
    			model: this.ai("@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code", {
    				reasoningEffort: "low",
    			}),
    			agent: "build",
    		},
    	});
    
    	lifecycle = Lifecycle.install(this).use(this.harness);
    
    	async ask(prompt) {
    		const { status, text, reason } = await this.harness.prompt(prompt);
    		return { status, text, reason };
    	}
    }
    
    
    import { DurableObject } from "cloudflare:workers";
    import { Lifecycle } from "agents/lifecycle";
    import { OpenCodeWorkerd } from "@opencode/sdk/workerd";
    import { OpenCodeHarness } from "agents/harness/opencode";
    import { createAI } from "agents/models/opencode";
    import workerTools from "./worker-tools";
    
    export class Assistant extends DurableObject<Env> {
    	ai = createAI({ binding: this.env.AI });
    	harness = new OpenCodeHarness({
    		opencode: ({ storage }) =>
    			OpenCodeWorkerd.create({
    				storage,
    				models: { fetch: false },
    				plugins: [this.ai.plugin, workerTools],
    			}),
    		defaults: {
    			model: this.ai("@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code", {
    				reasoningEffort: "low",
    			}),
    			agent: "build",
    		},
    	});
    
    	lifecycle = Lifecycle.install(this).use(this.harness);
    
    	async ask(prompt: string) {
    		const { status, text, reason } = await this.harness.prompt(prompt);
    		return { status, text, reason };
    	}
    }

The [OpenCode harness guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/harnesses/opencode/) includes the `workerTools` plugin, Wrangler configuration, and session APIs. The [working example ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/next/harnesses/opencode) adds a browser UI, WebSocket streaming, and Workspace tools from `@cloudflare/computer` for files and code execution.

## [Workers Builds now posts preview URLs in seconds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-12-faster-pull-request-comments/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Workers Builds now consistently posts preview URLs to GitHub pull requests and GitLab merge requests within a few seconds of a build completing, so you can start testing and reviewing your changes sooner. Previously, posting preview URLs could often take minutes.

For details, refer to [Workers Builds GitHub integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/github-integration/#pull-request-comment) and [Workers Builds GitLab integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/gitlab-integration/#merge-request-comment).

## [More time for requests to finish during Workers runtime updates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-12-longer-runtime-update-grace-period/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Pending requests and connections to Workers now have a grace period of up to 20 minutes during Workers runtime updates. Previously, the grace period was up to 30 seconds.

This gives long-running HTTP requests, streamed AI responses, and live WebSocket sessions more time to continue before an update interrupts them.

![Workers runtime versions: existing work drains on the previous version; new HTTP requests use the updated version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=920,height=414,format=svg/_astro/runtime-update-grace-period.B6z5mX9l.svg)

New incoming HTTP requests go to the updated version of the Workers runtime once it is ready. Processes running the previous version stop accepting these requests and drain existing work. The grace period applies to each process running the previous version. When it ends, unfinished requests and open connections on that process are terminated.

You should design your application to reconnect WebSockets, safely retry interrupted requests, and recover saved state after a restart. WebSockets can disconnect before the grace period ends, including connections using the [WebSocket Hibernation API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/best-practices/websockets/).

For more information, refer to [Workers runtime updates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#runtime-updates).

## [Create Workflow instance batches by count or list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-08-create-batch-object-form/)

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[`createBatch()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#createbatch) now accepts an options object that creates up to 100 Workflow instances in one call. The result lists the created instances and explains why any others were not created. To use this form in local development and get its types from `wrangler types`, use Wrangler 4.148.0 or later.

To create instances that share the same options, pass `count`. Each instance receives a generated ID:
    
    
    const result = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.createBatch({
    	count: 10,
    	params: { report: "daily" },
    });
    
    
    const result = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.createBatch({
    	count: 10,
    	params: { report: "daily" },
    });

To give each instance its own ID or options, pass `instances`:
    
    
    const { created, errors } = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.createBatch({
    	instances: [
    		{ id: "order-1", params: { orderId: 1 } },
    		{ id: "order-2", params: { orderId: 2 } },
    	],
    });
    
    for (const error of errors) {
    	console.log(error.index, error.id, error.code, error.message);
    }
    
    
    const { created, errors } = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.createBatch({
    	instances: [
    		{ id: "order-1", params: { orderId: 1 } },
    		{ id: "order-2", params: { orderId: 2 } },
    	],
    });
    
    for (const error of errors) {
    	console.log(error.index, error.id, error.code, error.message);
    }

`created` contains the created instances. `errors` contains each entry that was not created, identified by its position in the input. IDs that already exist and IDs repeated within the batch are reported as errors instead of being skipped silently.

Passing an array to `createBatch()` is deprecated. Existing code that uses the array form continues to work.

For more information, refer to [`createBatch`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#createbatch).

## [Run the Pi Durable harness on Cloudflare with the Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-02-pi-harness/)

[Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

The [Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) now provides first-class support for building agents using the Pi harness. You can build long-running agents using the combination of [Pi 1.0 ↗︎](https://earendil.com/posts/pi-1-0/), [Pi Durable ↗︎](https://earendil.com/posts/pi-durable/), and the new `PiHarness` class that the Cloudflare Agents SDK provides, ensuring your agent's work is durably persisted, even if interrupted mid-turn.

Built with [Earendil ↗︎](https://earendil.com/), this integration is our first step toward first-class support for third-party agent harnesses on Cloudflare.

![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/claude/light.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/claude/dark.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/codex/light.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/codex/dark.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/cursor/light.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/cursor/dark.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/opencode/light.svg)![](https://developers.cloudflare.com/icons/agents/opencode/dark.svg)Copy promptPrompt copied!

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/agents/tree/main/examples/next/harnesses/pi)

Beta

`PiHarness` is in beta. [Pi Durable ↗︎](https://earendil.com/posts/pi-durable/) is a new, experimental package, and the `PiHarness` API will likely change as Pi Durable matures.

`PiHarness` is a new "Lifecycle capability" provided by the Cloudflare Agents SDK. Pi Durable provides the agent harness and the Lifecycle is responsible for keeping the agent running in the Durable Object. The Lifecycle is a core concept in the Agents SDK ensuring that long-running work can run in a Durable Object, surviving restarts, crashes, and network issues. We will share more on Lifecycle capabilities in the near future.

#### Install

npmyarnpnpmbun
    
    
    npm i agents@latest @earendil-works/pi-durable @earendil-works/pi-ai
    
    
    yarn add agents@latest @earendil-works/pi-durable @earendil-works/pi-ai
    
    
    pnpm add agents@latest @earendil-works/pi-durable @earendil-works/pi-ai
    
    
    bun add agents@latest @earendil-works/pi-durable @earendil-works/pi-ai

Both Pi packages are optional peer dependencies of `agents`, so you only install them if you use the harness.

#### Use it in an Agent

Creating a Pi agent requires configuring the Pi `Harness` with a model, skills, and tools, then registering the `PiHarness` with the `Agent` class.
    
    
    import { Agent } from "agents";
    import { createModels } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/models";
    import { createRegistry, Harness } from "@earendil-works/pi-durable";
    import { PiHarness } from "agents/harness/pi";
    import { createAI } from "agents/models/pi-ai";
    
    export class Assistant extends Agent {
    	ai = createAI({ binding: this.env.AI });
    	registry = createRegistry();
    
    	harness = new PiHarness({
    		harness: ({ storage, context }) => {
    			const models = createModels();
    			models.setProvider(this.ai.provider);
    			return Harness.open(
    				storage,
    				{ models, registry: this.registry },
    				context,
    			);
    		},
    		defaults: { model: this.ai("@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code") },
    	});
    
    	constructor(ctx, env) {
    		super(ctx, env);
    		this.lifecycle.use(this.harness);
    	}
    
    	async ask(prompt) {
    		const { text } = await this.harness.prompt(prompt);
    		return text;
    	}
    }
    
    
    import { Agent } from "agents";
    import { createModels } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai/models";
    import { createRegistry, Harness } from "@earendil-works/pi-durable";
    import { PiHarness } from "agents/harness/pi";
    import { createAI } from "agents/models/pi-ai";
    
    export class Assistant extends Agent<Env> {
    	ai = createAI({ binding: this.env.AI });
    	registry = createRegistry();
    
    	harness = new PiHarness({
    		harness: ({ storage, context }) => {
    			const models = createModels();
    			models.setProvider(this.ai.provider);
    			return Harness.open(
    				storage,
    				{ models, registry: this.registry },
    				context,
    			);
    		},
    		defaults: { model: this.ai("@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code") },
    	});
    
    	constructor(ctx: DurableObjectState, env: Env) {
    		super(ctx, env);
    		this.lifecycle.use(this.harness);
    	}
    
    	async ask(prompt: string) {
    		const { text } = await this.harness.prompt(prompt);
    		return text;
    	}
    }

The `agents/models/pi-ai` entry point supports AI Gateway and Workers AI models, so you can get started with Cloudflare models right away or use your existing Pi AI provider.

#### Add tools with extensions

Both tools and system prompt sections are provided to the Pi `Harness` via extensions.
    
    
    import { Type } from "@earendil-works/pi-ai";

## [The best way to do MCP auth just got better: Workers OAuth Provider goes v1, with a new split API and full support for MCP 2026-07-28](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-01-workers-oauth-provider-1x/)

[Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider) is now v1, with a new split API. One Worker acts as the authorization server: it signs users in and issues tokens. Your MCP server acts as the resource server, and can run in another Worker. It validates each token with the authorization server over a [Service Binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/), without crossing the public Internet.

  * It supports the [MCP 2026-07-28 authorization specification ↗︎](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/basic/authorization), including [Client ID Metadata Documents ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/docs/authorization-server.md#client-id-metadata-documents) and [issuer identification ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/docs/authorization-server.md#authorization-response-issuer). It still works with older clients, including those using [Dynamic Client Registration ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/docs/authorization-server.md#dynamic-client-registration).
  * `insufficientScope()` gives you [step-up authorization ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/docs/authorization-server.md#scopes-and-step-up-authorization) in one line.
  * The authorization server and the resource server can run in [different Workers ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/docs/resource-servers.md#separate-workers) with different [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/) and [rate limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) rules.
  * One authorization server can issue tokens for [many MCP servers ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/docs/authorization-server.md#resources-and-token-audiences).
  * A [migration skill ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/blob/main/skills/migrate-to-1.0/SKILL.md) ships in the npm package so a coding agent can perform the upgrade.



#### The split API
    
    
    import {
    	OAuthAuthorizationServer,
    	OAuthResourceServer,
    	insufficientScope,
    } from "@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider";
    import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";
    
    // auth-server Worker: signs users in and issues tokens for both MCP servers.
    const authorizationServer = new OAuthAuthorizationServer({
    	issuer: "https://auth.example.com",
    	resources: [
    		"https://calendar.example.com/mcp",
    		"https://drive.example.com/mcp",
    	],
    	scopesSupported: ["calendar:read", "calendar:write", "offline_access"],
    	clientIdMetadataDocumentEnabled: true,
    });
    
    export class AuthServer extends WorkerEntrypoint {
    	fetch(request) {
    		if (new URL(request.url).pathname === "/authorize") {
    			return showConsent(request, this.env);
    		}
    		return authorizationServer.fetch(request, this.env, this.ctx);
    	}
    
    	validateToken(resource, token) {
    		return authorizationServer.validateToken(resource, token, this.env);
    	}
    }
    
    // calendar MCP Worker: checks tokens with AuthServer over a Service Binding.
    export const calendar = new OAuthResourceServer({
    	resourceMetadata: {
    		resource: "https://calendar.example.com/mcp",
    		authorization_servers: ["https://auth.example.com"],
    	},
    	requiredScopes: ["calendar:read"],
    	validateToken: (env) => env.AUTH_SERVER.validateToken,
    	handler: {
    		fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    			if (
    				request.method === "POST" &&
    				!ctx.auth.scope.includes("calendar:write")
    			) {
    				return insufficientScope(ctx.auth, ["calendar:read", "calendar:write"]);
    			}
    			return handleMcp(request, ctx.props);
    		},
    	},
    });
    
    
    import {
    	OAuthAuthorizationServer,
    	OAuthResourceServer,
    	insufficientScope,
    } from "@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider";
    import { WorkerEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";
    
    // auth-server Worker: signs users in and issues tokens for both MCP servers.
    const authorizationServer = new OAuthAuthorizationServer<Env>({
    	issuer: "https://auth.example.com",
    	resources: [
    		"https://calendar.example.com/mcp",
    		"https://drive.example.com/mcp",
    	],
    	scopesSupported: ["calendar:read", "calendar:write", "offline_access"],
    	clientIdMetadataDocumentEnabled: true,
    });
    
    export class AuthServer extends WorkerEntrypoint<Env> {
    	fetch(request: Request) {
    		if (new URL(request.url).pathname === "/authorize") {
    			return showConsent(request, this.env);
    		}
    		return authorizationServer.fetch(request, this.env, this.ctx);
    	}
    
    	validateToken(resource: string, token: string) {
    		return authorizationServer.validateToken(resource, token, this.env);
    	}
    }
    
    // calendar MCP Worker: checks tokens with AuthServer over a Service Binding.
    export const calendar = new OAuthResourceServer<Env, AuthProps>({
    	resourceMetadata: {
    		resource: "https://calendar.example.com/mcp",
    		authorization_servers: ["https://auth.example.com"],
    	},
    	requiredScopes: ["calendar:read"],
    	validateToken: (env) => env.AUTH_SERVER.validateToken,
    	handler: {
    		fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    			if (
    				request.method === "POST" &&
    				!ctx.auth.scope.includes("calendar:write")
    			) {
    				return insufficientScope(ctx.auth, ["calendar:read", "calendar:write"]);
    			}
    			return handleMcp(request, ctx.props);
    		},
    	},
    });

In the example, `env.AUTH_SERVER.validateToken` is that Service Binding call. The calendar Worker needs no KV namespace of its own.
    
    
    {
    	"name": "calendar-mcp",
    	"main": "src/index.ts",
    	// Set this to today's date
    	"compatibility_date": "2026-10-19",
    	"services": [
    		{
    			"binding": "AUTH_SERVER",
    			"service": "auth-server",
    			"entrypoint": "AuthServer",
    		},
    	],
    }
    
    
    name = "calendar-mcp"
    main = "src/index.ts"
    # Set this to today's date
    compatibility_date = "2026-10-19"
    
    [[services]]
    binding = "AUTH_SERVER"
    service = "auth-server"
    entrypoint = "AuthServer"

`OAuthResourceServer` publishes the [RFC 9728 ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728) protected resource metadata that MCP clients use to find your authorization server. It answers requests without a token with a `401` challenge that points to that metadata. It also rejects tokens issued for any other resource.

You can still use `OAuthProvider` as both the authorization server and the MCP server. For most 0.x deployments, the only required change is to add `resourceMetadata: { resource }`.

## [Artifacts is now in open beta](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-01-artifacts-open-beta/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/), Cloudflare's versioned file system that speaks Git, is now in open beta. Artifacts is built for scale, so you can create a repository per project, user, session, or task.

With Artifacts, you can:

  * **Deploy repositories to Workers** — Connect an Artifacts repository through [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/artifacts-integration/). Pushes to the production branch deploy the updated Worker, while other branches create or update [Worker Previews](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/).
  * **Programmatically manage repositories** — Use an [Artifacts binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/workers-binding/) from a Worker to create or fork repos, inspect files and commits, read files by path, and issue repo-scoped Git tokens.
  * **React to repository changes** — [Subscribe to events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/event-subscriptions/) when a repository is created, imported, forked, deleted, pushed to, cloned, or fetched.
  * **Control where repository data is stored** — Choose to [store and process](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/data-localization/) your data in the US or EU.
  * **Monitor repository usage** — View total operations, pulls, pushes, errors, and error rates in the Cloudflare dashboard or [via API for analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/observability/metrics/).



Artifacts is available for customers on the Workers Paid plan. Cloudflare will begin [billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/platform/pricing/) for Artifacts on October 14, 2026.

#### Build the next GitHub on Cloudflare

## [Web Crypto adds ML-KEM and ML-DSA support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-28-webcrypto-modern-algorithms/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

The Workers Web Crypto API now supports ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024, ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87. ML-KEM establishes shared secrets, while ML-DSA signs and verifies data.

The opt-in API also adds key encapsulation and decapsulation methods, `getPublicKey()`, `SubtleCrypto.supports()`, and JSON Web Keys (JWKs) with the `AKP` key type.

Turn on the `webcrypto_modern_algorithms` compatibility flag to use these features:
    
    
    {
      "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
      "compatibility_flags": [
        "webcrypto_modern_algorithms"
      ]
    }
    
    
    compatibility_flags = ["webcrypto_modern_algorithms"]

This example uses ML-KEM-768 to establish the same shared secret on both sides:

src/index.jsjs
    
    
    const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey("ML-KEM-768", false, [
    	"encapsulateBits",
    	"decapsulateBits",
    ]);
    
    if (!("publicKey" in keyPair)) {
    	throw new Error("Expected an ML-KEM key pair");
    }
    
    const { sharedKey, ciphertext } = await crypto.subtle.encapsulateBits(
    	"ML-KEM-768",
    	keyPair.publicKey,
    );
    
    const recoveredSharedKey = await crypto.subtle.decapsulateBits(
    	"ML-KEM-768",
    	keyPair.privateKey,
    	ciphertext,
    );

src/index.tsts
    
    
    const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey("ML-KEM-768", false, [
    	"encapsulateBits",
    	"decapsulateBits",
    ]);
    
    if (!("publicKey" in keyPair)) {
    	throw new Error("Expected an ML-KEM key pair");
    }
    
    const { sharedKey, ciphertext } = await crypto.subtle.encapsulateBits(
    	"ML-KEM-768",
    	keyPair.publicKey,
    );
    
    const recoveredSharedKey = await crypto.subtle.decapsulateBits(
    	"ML-KEM-768",
    	keyPair.privateKey,
    	ciphertext,
    );

Workers implements a subset of the evolving [Modern Algorithms in the Web Cryptography API ↗︎](https://wicg.github.io/webcrypto-modern-algos/) draft. ML-KEM-512 and the draft's other algorithms are not supported. The API may change as the draft evolves.

For current algorithm and operation support, refer to [Web Crypto supported algorithms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/web-crypto/#supported-algorithms).

## [Workers Cache — mark cached responses stale with invalidate()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-29-workers-cache-invalidate/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Workers Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cache/) now supports `invalidate()`, the soft counterpart of `purge()`. `purge()` deletes matching cached responses, so the next request is a cache miss. `invalidate()` keeps them but marks them stale, so the cache revalidates them with your Worker instead.

To revalidate a response, the cache sends your Worker a conditional request built from the validators stored with it — for example, `If-None-Match` carrying the cached `ETag`. If your Worker answers `304 Not Modified`, the cache keeps the stored body. If your Worker answers with a full `200` response, that response replaces the cached one.

`invalidate()` accepts the same options as `purge()`: `tags`, `pathPrefixes`, or `purgeEverything`. It follows the same per-entrypoint scoping and resolves to the same result object. Call it as `ctx.cache.invalidate()`, or import `cache` from `cloudflare:workers` and call `cache.invalidate()`.

Use `invalidate()` when one call covers many cached responses but only some of them changed. Your Worker needs to emit `ETag` or `Last-Modified` and answer matching conditional requests with `304`. Each unchanged response then costs a validator check instead of a full regeneration:

src/index.jsjs
    
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    		if (request.method === "POST") {
    			// Write the updated catalog, then mark every cached product page stale.
    			await syncCatalog(env, await request.json());
    			await ctx.cache.invalidate({ tags: ["products"] });
    			return new Response("Synced");
    		}
    
    		const product = await getProduct(env, request);
    		const etag = `"${product.revision}"`;
    		const headers = {
    			"Cache-Control": "public, max-age=86400",
    			"Cache-Tag": "products",
    			ETag: etag,
    		};
    
    		// The product has not changed since it was cached. Answer 304, and the
    		// cache keeps the body it already has.
    		if (request.headers.get("If-None-Match") === etag) {
    			return new Response(null, { status: 304, headers });
    		}
    
    		return new Response(renderProductPage(product), { headers });
    	},
    };

src/index.tsts
    
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    		if (request.method === "POST") {
    			// Write the updated catalog, then mark every cached product page stale.
    			await syncCatalog(env, await request.json());
    			await ctx.cache.invalidate({ tags: ["products"] });
    			return new Response("Synced");
    		}
    
    		const product = await getProduct(env, request);
    		const etag = `"${product.revision}"`;
    		const headers = {
    			"Cache-Control": "public, max-age=86400",
    			"Cache-Tag": "products",
    			ETag: etag,
    		};
    
    		// The product has not changed since it was cached. Answer 304, and the
    		// cache keeps the body it already has.
    		if (request.headers.get("If-None-Match") === etag) {
    			return new Response(null, { status: 304, headers });
    		}
    
    		return new Response(renderProductPage(product), { headers });
    	},
    } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

## [Cloudflare CLI is now in beta](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-28-cloudflare-cli-beta/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/)

The [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`, is now in beta. `cf` is one command-line interface for the public Cloudflare API and for Workers projects. Use it to manage zones, DNS, storage, and security settings, and to create, develop, and deploy Workers, without switching between tools.

Install `cf` globally, then sign in:

npmyarnpnpmbun
    
    
    npm install --global cf
    
    
    yarn global add cf
    
    
    pnpm add --global cf
    
    
    bun add --global cf
    
    
    cf auth login

With `cf`, you can:

  * **Manage resources across Cloudflare.** More than 2,900 commands cover the public Cloudflare API, and most print their results as JSON.
  * **Create and deploy Workers.** `cf init` creates a project that uses [`cloudflare.config.ts`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/projects/cloudflare-config/), a typed configuration file. `cf dev`, `cf build`, and `cf deploy` develop, build, and deploy it.
  * **Move from Wrangler.** `cf migrate` converts a Wrangler configuration file to `cloudflare.config.ts`. You can also run `cf` resource commands in an existing Wrangler project without migrating it.
  * **Work with coding agents.** `cf cli search` finds the command for a task from a plain-language description, so an agent can find and run commands without prior knowledge of `cf`.



`cf` is in beta. Commands, configuration, and Build Output can change before the stable release.

To get started, refer to [Install and sign in](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/get-started/). To move an existing project, refer to [Migrate a Wrangler project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/wrangler/migrate/).

## [Call Workflows declared in `exports` through `ctx.exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-27-workflow-ctx-exports/)

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

A Worker can now call the Workflows it declares in the [`exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#workflow-exports) field of its Wrangler configuration through [`ctx.exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context/#exports). You no longer need a `workflows` binding to call a Workflow from the Worker that defines it.

Each Workflow is keyed by class name, and has the same API as a Workflow binding:

src/index.jsjs
    
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    		const instance = await ctx.exports.MyWorkflow.create({
    			params: { name: "World" },
    		});
    		return Response.json({ id: instance.id });
    	},
    };

src/index.tsts
    
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    		const instance = await ctx.exports.MyWorkflow.create({
    			params: { name: "World" },
    		});
    		return Response.json({ id: instance.id });
    	},
    } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

A `workflows` binding and a `workflow` export with the same `name` share their instances. You can move a Workflow from a binding to an export without losing its instances.

`wrangler dev`, the [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/), and the [Workers Vitest integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/) run Workflows on `ctx.exports` locally. Local development requires Wrangler 4.142.0, `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` 1.61.0, or `@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` 1.3.0 or above.

In Vitest, `introspectWorkflow()` and `introspectWorkflowInstance()` still need a Workflow binding. To introspect a Workflow declared in `exports`, add a [test-only binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/test-apis/#introspect-workflows-declared-in-exports) to it.

For more information, refer to [Call a Workflow through `ctx.exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#call-a-workflow-through-ctxexports).

## [Workers tracing — new getActiveSpan(), recordException(), startSpan(), and setAttributes() APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-25-custom-span-apis/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Custom spans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/custom-spans/) in Workers now support more of the OpenTelemetry span API, so you can instrument more of your code and record errors directly on your spans.

  * **`tracing.startSpan(name)`** creates a span without making it the active span, and returns it. Other spans do not nest under it. Call `span.end()` when the operation is complete.
  * **`tracing.getActiveSpan()`** returns the currently active span. Use it to annotate the current span from helper functions and libraries without passing the span object through your code. Outside any custom span, it returns the invocation's root span.
  * **`span.recordException(exception)`** records an exception event on a span. It accepts an `Error`, a string, or an object with a `code`, `name`, or `message`.
  * **`span.setAttributes(attributes)`** sets multiple attributes at once. `setAttribute()` and `setAttributes()` now return the span, so you can chain calls.



src/index.jsjs
    
    
    import { tracing } from "cloudflare:workers";
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env) {
    		const user = await authenticate(request, env);
    
    		// Annotate the invocation's root span
    		tracing.getActiveSpan()?.setAttributes({
    			"user.id": user.id,
    			"user.plan": user.plan,
    		});
    
    		const span = tracing.startSpan("load-profile");
    		try {
    			return Response.json(await loadProfile(env, user.id));
    		} catch (err) {
    			span.recordException(err);
    			throw err;
    		} finally {
    			span.end();
    		}
    	},
    };

## [See every release and gradual deployment on Workers Metrics charts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-25-release-flows-workers-metrics/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Workers Metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics-and-analytics/) charts now show every release in the selected time range, including the full progression of [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/). This makes it easier to correlate changes in memory, CPU time, errors, or latency with the code that was serving traffic.

![Memory usage chart showing a gradual deployment as a shaded rollout band](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2400,height=1350,format=webp/_astro/2026-09-25-release-flow-memory-usage.C5rkO7VY.png)

A gradual deployment appears as a single rollout across the chart, with shading that increases as more traffic moves to the new version. Hover over a rollout to see the previous and new versions, the rollout duration, and the traffic percentage configured at each step.

![Invocations chart showing traffic shifting from the previous version to the new version during a gradual deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2400,height=1350,format=webp/_astro/2026-09-25-release-flow-invocations.BvQMAKnw.png)

Use these annotations to:

  * **Find when a regression started** — See which traffic percentage was configured when errors, latency, CPU time, or wall time changed.
  * **Compare rollout stages** — Check whether a metric changed as more traffic moved to the new version.
  * **Confirm rollbacks** — Rollbacks appear as separate release events, so you can check whether metrics recovered after a rollback.



Direct deployments that send 100% of traffic to a single version still appear as individual markers. Nearby direct deployments are grouped to reduce visual clutter. Versions that are only uploaded, or only configured at 0%, do not appear on metrics charts.

To view release annotations, open the **Metrics** tab for your [Worker ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/services/view/:worker/production/metrics).

## [Declare Workflows in the `exports` configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-24-workflow-exports/)

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

You can now declare the Workflows a Worker defines in the [`exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#workflow-exports) field of your Wrangler configuration file. Previously, a Worker could only define a Workflow through a `workflows` binding, even when the Worker never called the Workflow itself.

Key each entry by the name of the class that extends `WorkflowEntrypoint`:
    
    
    {
    	"exports": {
    		"MyWorkflow": {
    			"type": "workflow",
    			"name": "my-workflow",
    			"limits": {
    				"steps": 25000,
    			},
    			"schedules": ["0 * * * *"],
    		},
    	},
    }
    
    
    [exports.MyWorkflow]
    type = "workflow"
    name = "my-workflow"
    schedules = [ "0 * * * *" ]
    
      [exports.MyWorkflow.limits]
      steps = 25_000

A `workflow` export accepts the same settings as a `workflows` binding: `limits`, `schedules`, and `default_retention`. When you run `wrangler deploy`, Wrangler creates or updates the Workflow with these settings.

You can declare a Workflow as both a binding and an export. Both declarations must use the same class, and cannot set the same setting to different values.

A `workflows` binding to a Workflow in another Worker cannot use the same `name` as a Workflow export in this Worker. Workflow names are unique per account.

Workflow exports require Wrangler 4.139.0 or above.

For more information, refer to [Declare Workflows in `exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#declare-workflows-in-exports).

## [Workers Builds now supports Cursor Origin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-22-cursor-origin-workers-builds/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Workers Builds now supports repositories hosted in Cursor Origin. Connect a Cursor Origin repository to automatically build and deploy production changes, preview non-production branches, and see build status in pull requests.

Pushes to your production branch automatically build and deploy your Worker. When you enable [non-production branch builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-branches/#configure-non-production-branch-builds), each branch receives a version-specific preview URL and a stable preview URL that follows the latest build.

Cloudflare posts build status and preview links to the Cursor Origin pull request and creates a check run for each triggered build.

To get started, install the [Cloudflare app in Cursor ↗︎](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps/public/cloudflare), choose the Cursor Origin repositories Cloudflare can access, and follow the prompts to configure your Worker build. For details, refer to the [Cursor Origin integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/cursor-origin-integration/).

## [Test every pull request in an isolated environment with Worker Previews](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-22-worker-previews/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

You can now test every change you make in an isolated, production-like environment with [Worker Previews ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/worker-previews/). [Each Preview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/) runs under the same Worker with its own code, configuration, URL, and observability, isolated from production and every other Preview.

#### Configure each Preview

Define the variables, bindings, and settings that new Previews start with in the [`previews` block of your Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/configuration/). Set secrets with Wrangler commands. You can override one Preview without changing production or other Previews.

For [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/resources/#durable-objects) and [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/resources/#containers), Cloudflare automatically provisions separate namespaces, storage, apps, and instances for every Preview. State changes, sessions, memory, migrations, and concurrent tests remain scoped to that Preview. To isolate KV, D1, R2, or another account-level resource, [bind the Preview to a separate resource](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/resources/).

![Diagram comparing production with three Previews, each with its own URL, code, configuration, and Durable Object state](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1999,height=1370,format=webp/_astro/preview-resource-isolation.CyeUXRJS.png)

#### Deploy and share every change

Use Wrangler 4.135.0 or later to [deploy a Preview](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/get-started/):
    
    
    npx wrangler preview

Or [connect your repository to Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-branches/#configure-preview-builds) to create Previews automatically and post their URLs to pull requests.

Each Preview gets a [stable URL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/#urls) that updates with every push, so reviewers always see the latest changes. Each deployment also gets an immutable URL, so you can compare or return to an exact version.

After you create a Preview, use the environment breadcrumb next to your Worker's name to switch between Production and every Preview:

![Worker dashboard showing the Preview dropdown and an overview of bindings, metrics, and deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2386,height=1304,format=webp/_astro/previews-dash-overview.BL1UHZHT.png)

#### Inspect and revise before production

Each Preview has its own [logs, errors, metrics, and traces](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/test-and-debug/). Send traffic to its URL, inspect what happened, push a fix, and verify the next deployment before production.

![Preview Observability tab showing success and error events for a pull request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1418,height=1236,format=webp/_astro/preview-observability.COYT0y5H.png)

#### Use production-like hostnames

Serve Preview URLs on `workers.dev`, a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/custom-domains/), or both. Custom domains let authentication providers, cookies, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), and OAuth redirects work as they will in production. You can also protect Preview URLs with Cloudflare Access.

Configure a domain for Preview traffic from the Worker's **Domains** tab:

![Domains tab showing a custom domain configured for Preview traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2876,height=1454,format=webp/_astro/customdomainonly.8AG_6tc-.png)

## [Give teammates access to specific Workers directly from the dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-21-invite-members-to-workers/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

You can now grant teammates scoped access to specific Workers directly from the Workers dashboard.

Go to your Worker and click **Invite**.

![Invite button on a Worker's overview page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2366,height=1134,format=webp/_astro/invite-button.BtZmWRrA.png)

Enter the teammate's email address, choose the appropriate access level, and click **Invite**.

![Dialog for inviting a teammate and choosing their access level](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=748,height=724,format=webp/_astro/invite-dialog.Bo5P-iat.png)

You can grant a user one of the following access levels:

  * **Metadata Read-Only** : View settings, metrics, logs, and traces without access to Worker code or the ability to make changes.
  * **Content Read-Only** : Read Worker code, settings, and observability data without the ability to modify or deploy changes.
  * **Editor** : Update and deploy a Worker without the ability to delete it.
  * **Admin** : Everything included with Editor, plus the ability to delete the Worker.



If the teammate is already an account member, they will receive access to the Worker immediately. If they are not an account member, Cloudflare will send them an invitation to join the account, and they will receive access to the Worker after accepting the invitation.

Only account members with the Super Administrator role can invite users from a Worker's dashboard.

For details about available roles and scopes, refer to the [Workers roles and permissions documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/authorization/workers/).

## [Delete Workflow instances individually or in batches](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-17-instance-delete/)

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

You can now delete one or up to 100 Workflow instances and their stored state via the [Workflows API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/) or Wrangler 4.125.0 and later. Deleting an instance frees its stored state and stops its current execution. [Storage billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/reference/pricing/#storage-usage) is based on the average daily peak.

Delete one instance by calling [`delete()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#delete) on its handle:
    
    
    const instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("instance-abc");
    await instance.delete();

If a Workflow deletes its own instance, execution stops during `await instance.delete()`. Code after the call does not run.

Delete multiple instances by calling [`deleteBatch()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#deletebatch) on the Workflow binding:
    
    
    const result = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.deleteBatch([
    	"instance-abc",
    	"instance-def",
    ]);
    
    console.log(result.deleted);
    console.log(result.errors);

The batch result contains `{ id }` entries for successful deletions and per-instance errors. IDs that do not exist are returned as errors. Duplicate IDs count toward the limit and are deleted once, with the result repeated for each input position.

Wrangler accepts positional instance IDs, a file containing a top-level JSON array of strings, or both, up to 100 IDs total. Use `latest` to delete the most recently created instance. Use `--local` against a local `wrangler dev` session:

instance-ids.jsonjson
    
    
    ["instance-abc", "instance-def"]
    
    
    npx wrangler workflows instances delete my-workflow <INSTANCE_ID>
    npx wrangler workflows instances delete my-workflow <INSTANCE_ID> <INSTANCE_ID>
    npx wrangler workflows instances delete my-workflow latest
    npx wrangler workflows instances delete my-workflow --filename ./instance-ids.json
    npx wrangler workflows instances delete my-workflow <INSTANCE_ID> --local

For more information, refer to [Delete Workflow instances](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/trigger-workflows/#delete-workflow-instances), [`delete`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#delete), and [`deleteBatch`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#deletebatch).

## [Workers traces now automatically include JavaScript RPC session spans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-17-javascript-rpc-session-spans/)

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)

Workers traces can now follow JavaScript RPC calls across Worker boundaries and into Durable Objects. Previously, a trace stopped at the caller's RPC boundary. The dashboard now shows the caller-side session and method calls alongside the callee invocation, nested calls, and callbacks into another Worker.

A session span covers the lifetime of a caller-side session and groups calls that reuse it. Individual call spans show each method invocation. Execution colors distinguish the Workers or Durable Object entrypoints involved, while arrows mark outgoing and incoming calls. Together, these details show where time was spent, which calls reused a session, and how returned stubs and callbacks fit into the request.

![A Workers trace of a Worker-to-Worker RPC session, showing the session span, the caller's getCounter and increment call spans, and the callee's invocation and matching call spans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2878,height=1576,format=webp/_astro/jsrpc-session-spans.DQuwQrpm.png)

Enable tracing with one setting in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#observability):
    
    
    {
      "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
      "observability": {
        "traces": {
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    
    
    [observability.traces]
    enabled = true

Cloudflare records these spans automatically. You do not need to change your application code or add an observability SDK.

For supported spans and attributes, refer to [Spans and attributes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/spans-and-attributes/).
