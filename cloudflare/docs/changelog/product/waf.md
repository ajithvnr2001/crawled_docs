## [Failed detections field available in Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-09-failed-detections/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

You can now use `cf.appsec.request.failed_detections` to control how your rules handle requests when a security detection reports a failure.

The field is an `Array<String>` of detection IDs that reports failures from content scanning, WAF attack score, attack signature detection, leaked credentials detection, and AI prompt detections for personally identifiable information (PII), prompt injection, custom topics, and unsafe topics.

The field does not alter the existing behavior of detections. Use it in rules to choose how to handle requests with reported failures.

When no failures are reported, the field returns `[]`. You can use it on all plans, but your plan must still include the detections and rule features you want to use.

Supported rules:

  * Custom rules at the zone and account levels
  * Rate limiting rules at the zone and account levels
  * Request Header Transform Rules at the zone level



Match any reported failure:
    
    
    len(cf.appsec.request.failed_detections) gt 0

Match a reported leaked credentials detection failure:
    
    
    any(cf.appsec.request.failed_detections[*] eq "waf_credential_check")

For more information, refer to the [Failed detections field reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.appsec.request.failed_detections/).

## [Updated unsafe topic detection for AI Security for Apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-07-ai-security-for-apps-unsafe-topic-detection/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

AI Security for Apps now supports an updated set of categories for detecting unsafe topics in incoming prompts.

The values available in [`cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories/) have changed. Existing WAF custom rules remain valid, but rules that reference a removed or renamed category will no longer match that category. Review any rules that use this field and update their expressions to use the currently supported values.

For category descriptions and configuration guidance, refer to [Unsafe topics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/unsafe-topics/).

## [Enforce positive security with Application Profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-07-application-profiles/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

Application Profiles add a positive-security layer to Cloudflare WAF. Instead of looking only for requests that resemble known attacks, Application Profiles learn what valid requests to your application look like and identify traffic that deviates from the expected structure.

The first available profile type, Schema Profiles, can learn path variables, query parameters, headers, cookies, JSON bodies, and form-encoded bodies. Profiles model field types and constraints such as numeric ranges, string lengths, and character classes. After a profile becomes available, an always-on detection classifies requests as conforming or non-conforming without blocking traffic.

Use **Profile Analysis** in [Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) to review conformance trends and sampled violation details before enforcing a profile. When you are ready to mitigate traffic, use a [Custom Rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) to scope enforcement by hostname, path, operation, or other security signals such as Attack Score.

Customers with API Security already have access to Schema Profiles through Schema Learning and Schema Validation. Cloudflare is also opening a closed beta to invited Enterprise customers without API Security. Contact your Cloudflare account team to express interest.

For more information, refer to [Application Profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/application-profiles/).

Sep 7, 2026

## [Attack Signature Detection is now available in Early Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-07-attack-signature-detection/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

Attack Signature Detection is now available in Early Access. It evaluates requests against Cloudflare attack signatures and records matches without applying a mitigation action, allowing you to investigate detected traffic before deciding how to respond.

In **Security Analytics** > **Attack Analysis** , you can review matching signature references, categories, confidence levels, and request outcomes. You can then use these fields in [Security Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security/rules/) and combine them with request properties such as hostname, path, and HTTP method to apply scoped mitigation.

Attack Signature Detection uses the same signature definitions as [Cloudflare Managed Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/), but it does not inherit your Managed Rules actions, overrides, or deployment configuration. Managed Rules remain the recommended baseline protection during Early Access.

Contact your Cloudflare account team to request access. For more information, refer to [Attack Signature Detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-signature-detection/).

Sep 1, 2026

## [Updated PII detection for AI Security for Apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-01-ai-security-for-apps-pii-detection/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

AI Security for Apps now supports an updated set of categories for detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in incoming prompts.

The values available in [`cf.llm.prompt.pii_categories`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.llm.prompt.pii_categories/) have changed. Existing WAF custom rules remain valid, but rules that reference a removed or renamed category will no longer match that category. Review any rules that use this field and update their expressions to use the currently supported values.

For the complete category list and configuration guidance, refer to [PII detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/pii-detection/).

## [WAF Release - 2026-08-26 - Emergency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-26-emergency-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This emergency release updates an existing Next.js remote code execution rule to identify CVE-2026-75604 and adds a new rule for remote code execution in the Next.js Image Optimizer via crafted AVIF images.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-75604 affects Windows-hosted Next.js applications using both the Pages Router and App Router without Cache Components and can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution.

  * GHSA-2xp9-vwfh-vxw4 affects the Next.js Image Optimizer and can lead to unauthenticated remote code execution when it optimizes an attacker-controlled AVIF image.




**Impact**

Next.js recommends updating to version 16.3.3 or 15.5.24 to address these vulnerabilities.

## [Leaked credentials detection now scans Authorization headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-08-20-leaked-credentials-authorization-header/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

[Leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) now scans the `Authorization` request header for Basic Authentication credentials. Previously, the detection only inspected request bodies, query strings, and headers for well-known web applications or custom detection locations, which meant credentials sent through HTTP Basic Authentication were not covered by default.

This new default scan location decodes the `Authorization: Basic <credentials>` header and compares the extracted username and password against Cloudflare's database of leaked credentials, the same way as other default scan locations. Matches populate the existing [leaked credentials fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/#leaked-credentials-fields), such as `cf.waf.credential_check.password_leaked`, and trigger the [`Exposed-Credential-Check` managed transform header](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/managed-transforms/reference/#add-leaked-credentials-checks-header) if configured, so you can reuse existing [custom rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/) and [rate limiting rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/) without changes.

This change was applied automatically for zones with leaked credentials detection enabled. No configuration changes are required.

For more information, refer to [Leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/).

## [WAF Release - 2026-07-29](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-07-29-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This release introduces new rules and updates existing threat signatures to provide targeted protections for vulnerabilities in Nuxt Server Island components and Alibaba Fastjson deserialization routines, alongside enhanced protections for cloud metadata Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and obfuscated command injection attempts.

**Key Findings**

  * Nuxt Server Island - RCE(GHSA-9473-5f9j-94wq): An unauthenticated vulnerability in Nuxt Server Islands where remote attackers can supply arbitrary component names or props to endpoints. Manipulating these parameters allows unauthenticated component Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

  * Alibaba Fastjson JSONType Remote Code Execution: A unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Alibaba Fastjson (≤ 1.2.83) during JSON deserialization. Under default configurations, attackers can execute arbitrary system commands, bypassing traditional classpath and gadget-based defenses.

  * Generic Protections (SSRF & Command Injection): Added improved detection logic targeting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in cloud-hosted applications, alongside new rules targeting obfuscated command injection patterns across request parameters.
