## Gateway Authorization Proxy and hosted PAC files (open beta)

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

The [Gateway Authorization Proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#authorization-endpoint) and [PAC file hosting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#create-a-hosted-pac-file) are now in open beta for all plan types.

Previously, [proxy endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#source-ip-endpoint) relied on static source IP addresses to authorize traffic, providing no user-level identity in logs or policies. The new authorization proxy replaces IP-based authorization with [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) authentication, verifying who a user is before applying Gateway filtering without installing the WARP client.

This is ideal for environments where you cannot deploy a device client, such as virtual desktops (VDI), mergers and acquisitions, or compliance-restricted endpoints.

#### Key capabilities

  * **Identity-aware proxy traffic** — Users authenticate through your identity provider (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, and others) via Cloudflare Access. Logs now show exactly which user accessed which site, and you can write [identity-based policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/identity-selectors/) like "only the Finance team can access this accounting tool."
  * **Multiple identity providers** — Display one or multiple login methods simultaneously, giving flexibility for organizations managing users across different identity systems.
  * **Cloudflare-hosted PAC files** — Create and host [PAC files](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#create-a-hosted-pac-file) directly in Cloudflare One with pre-configured templates for Okta and Azure, hosted at `https://pac.cloudflare-gateway.com/<account-id>/<slug>` on Cloudflare's global network.
  * **Simplified billing** — Each user occupies a seat, exactly like they do with the Cloudflare One Client. No new metrics to track.



#### Get started

  1. In [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Traffic controls** > **Proxy endpoints**.
  2. [Create an authorization proxy endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#authorization-endpoint) and configure Access policies.
  3. [Create a hosted PAC file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#create-a-hosted-pac-file) or write your own.
  4. [Configure browsers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#3b-configure-browser-to-use-pac-file) to use the PAC file URL.
  5. [Install the Cloudflare certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/user-side-certificates/) for HTTPS inspection.



For more details, refer to the [proxy endpoints documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/) and the [announcement blog post ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/gateway-authorization-proxy-identity-aware-policies/).
