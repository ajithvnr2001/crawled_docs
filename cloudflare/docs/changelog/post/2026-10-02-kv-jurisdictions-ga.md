## Workers KV namespace jurisdictions are now generally available

Jurisdictions for [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) namespaces are now generally available. When you create a namespace, you can set a [jurisdiction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/reference/data-location/) to make sure the namespace's data is only durably stored within that region. Jurisdictions can help you comply with data localization regulations such as GDPR or FedRAMP. Supported jurisdictions are `eu`, `us`, and `fedramp`.

A jurisdiction can only be set when a namespace is created, using the Cloudflare dashboard, Wrangler, the `cf` CLI, or the REST API, and cannot be added or changed afterwards.
    
    
    npx wrangler@latest kv namespace create <NAMESPACE_NAME> --jurisdiction=eu
    
    
    cf kv namespaces create --title <NAMESPACE_NAME> --jurisdiction eu
    
    
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/storage/kv/namespaces" \
      --request POST \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "title": "<NAMESPACE_NAME>",
        "jurisdiction": "eu"
      }'

Workers can still access a namespace restricted to a jurisdiction from anywhere in the world, and KV data can be cached outside the jurisdiction on Cloudflare's network. The jurisdiction only controls where the namespace's data is durably stored.
