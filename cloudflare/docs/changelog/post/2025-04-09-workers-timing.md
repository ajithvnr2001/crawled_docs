You can now observe and investigate the CPU time and Wall time for every Workers Invocations.

  * For [Workers Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs), CPU time and Wall time are surfaced in the [Invocation Log](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#invocation-logs)..
  * For [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers), CPU time and Wall time are surfaced at the top level of the [Workers Trace Events object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/workers_trace_events).
  * For [Workers Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/logpush), CPU and Wall time are surfaced at the top level of the [Workers Trace Events object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/workers_trace_events). All new jobs will have these new fields included by default. Existing jobs need to be updated to include CPU time and Wall time.



You can use a Workers Logs filter to search for logs where Wall time exceeds 100ms.
