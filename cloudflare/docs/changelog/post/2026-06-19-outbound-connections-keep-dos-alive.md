## Outbound connections keep Durable Objects alive

[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Durable Objects now remain alive for the duration of active outbound connections created via [`connect()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/tcp-sockets/) or an outbound WebSocket. Previously, a Durable Object would be evicted after 70-140 seconds of no incoming traffic, even if the object had an open outbound connection, which is a common pattern when streaming responses from a large language model (LLM) over TCP or an outbound WebSocket.

With this change, each active outbound connection prevents eviction. Once all outbound connections close, the standard 70-140 second inactivity window applies before the Durable Object is evicted.

#### Before: streaming connections were cut off by eviction

#### After: active outbound connections keep the Durable Object alive

If you are [building agents on Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/), this is especially relevant. An agent that streams tokens from an LLM while [calling models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/concepts/calling-llms/), or that performs [long-running tasks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/concepts/agentic-patterns/long-running-agents/) over an outbound connection, now stays alive for the duration of that connection instead of being evicted mid-stream.

**Limits:**

  * Each outbound connection keeps the Durable Object alive for a maximum of **15 minutes**. After 15 minutes, the connection stops preventing eviction (the connection itself continues operating), and the [standard eviction rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/concepts/durable-object-lifecycle/) resume.
  * The Durable Object's existing [per-account instance limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/limits/) still apply.
