## Restart a Hyperdrive configuration from the dashboard

You can now restart a Hyperdrive configuration from the Cloudflare dashboard. Restarting drains the connection pool and forces Hyperdrive to establish new connections to your origin database.

Restarting is a break-glass action. Hyperdrive automatically detects and recovers from most database failovers. Use a manual restart only when you need to force the pool to drain immediately.

To restart, select your Hyperdrive configuration in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com), go to the **Settings** tab, and select **Restart** under **Danger zone**. Restarting requires the [**Hyperdrive Admin** role](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/roles/). After a restart, the **Settings** tab shows when the configuration was last manually restarted.

Caution

Restarting drops all active connections in the pool and forces them to be re-established. In-flight queries may see brief errors while the pool rebuilds.

For more information, refer to [Connection pooling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/concepts/connection-pooling/).
