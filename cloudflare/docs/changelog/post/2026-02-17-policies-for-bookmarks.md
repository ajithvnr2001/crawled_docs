## Policies for bookmark applications

[Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can now assign [Access policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) to [bookmark applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/bookmarks/). This lets you control which users see a bookmark in the [App Launcher](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/app-launcher/) based on identity, device posture, and other policy rules.

Previously, bookmark applications were visible to all users in your organization. With policy support, you can now:

  * **Tailor the App Launcher to each user** — Users only see the applications they have access to, reducing clutter and preventing accidental clicks on irrelevant resources.
  * **Restrict visibility of sensitive bookmarks** — Limit who can view bookmarks to internal tools or partner resources based on group membership, identity provider, or device posture.



Bookmarks support all [Access policy configurations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) except purpose justification, temporary authentication, and application isolation. If no policy is assigned, the bookmark remains visible to all users (maintaining backwards compatibility).

For more information, refer to [Add bookmarks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/bookmarks/).
