## Gateway Authorization Proxy and hosted PAC files are now generally available

The [Gateway Authorization Proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#authorization-endpoint) and [hosted PAC files](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#create-a-hosted-pac-file) are now generally available for all plan types.

Authorization proxy endpoints add an identity-aware option alongside the existing [source IP proxy endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/#source-ip-endpoint), using [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) authentication to verify who a user is before applying Gateway filtering — without installing the [Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/). Cloudflare-hosted PAC files let you create and distribute PAC files directly from Cloudflare One on Cloudflare's global network.

These features are ideal for environments where deploying a device client is not an option, such as virtual desktops (VDI) or compliance-restricted endpoints.

To get started, refer to the [proxy endpoints documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/).
