## Declare Workflows in the `exports` configuration

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

You can now declare the Workflows a Worker defines in the [`exports`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#workflow-exports) field of your Wrangler configuration file. Previously, a Worker could only define a Workflow through a `workflows` binding, even when the Worker never called the Workflow itself.

Key each entry by the name of the class that extends `WorkflowEntrypoint`:
    
    
    {
    	"exports": {
    		"MyWorkflow": {
    			"type": "workflow",
    			"name": "my-workflow",
    			"limits": {
    				"steps": 25000,
    			},
    			"schedules": ["0 * * * *"],
    		},
    	},
    }
    
    
    [exports.MyWorkflow]
    type = "workflow"
    name = "my-workflow"
    schedules = [ "0 * * * *" ]
    
      [exports.MyWorkflow.limits]
      steps = 25_000

A `workflow` export accepts the same settings as a `workflows` binding: `limits`, `schedules`, and `default_retention`. When you run `wrangler deploy`, Wrangler creates or updates the Workflow with these settings.

You can declare a Workflow as both a binding and an export. Both declarations must use the same class, and cannot set the same setting to different values.

A `workflows` binding to a Workflow in another Worker cannot use the same `name` as a Workflow export in this Worker. Workflow names are unique per account.

Workflow exports require Wrangler 4.139.0 or above.
