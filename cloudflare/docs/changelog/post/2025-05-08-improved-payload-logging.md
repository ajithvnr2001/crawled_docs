## Improved Payload Logging for WAF Managed Rules

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

We have upgraded WAF Payload Logging to enhance rule diagnostics and usability:

  * **Targeted logging** : Logs now capture only the specific portions of requests that triggered WAF rules, rather than entire request segments.
  * **Visual highlighting** : Matched content is visually highlighted in the UI for faster identification.
  * **Enhanced context** : Logs now include surrounding context to make diagnostics more effective.

Payload Logging is available to all Enterprise customers. If you have not used Payload Logging before, check how you can [get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/payload-logging/).

**Note:** The structure of the `encrypted_matched_data` field in Logpush has changed from `Map<Field, Value>` to `Map<Field, {Before: bytes, Content: Value, After: bytes}>`. If you rely on this field in your Logpush jobs, you should review and update your processing logic accordingly.
