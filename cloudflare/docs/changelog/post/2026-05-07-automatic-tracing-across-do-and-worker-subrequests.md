## Automatic tracing across Durable Object and Worker subrequests

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

You can now get a single unified trace across Worker-to-Worker subrequests, with trace context propagating automatically. Previously, [automatic tracing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/) produced disconnected traces when a Worker called another Worker through a [service binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/) or [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/).

This means you can:

  * Follow a request through your entire Worker architecture in one trace view
  * See service binding and Durable Object calls as nested child spans instead of separate traces
  * Debug cross-Worker request flows in the Cloudflare dashboard or in an external observability platform via [OpenTelemetry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/opentelemetry-export/)



[Tracing must be enabled](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/#how-to-enable-tracing) in your Wrangler configuration for traces to be recorded. Checkout [Workers tracing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/) to get started.

Up next, we are working on external trace context propagation using [W3C Trace Context standards ↗︎](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/), which will allow traces from your Workers to link with traces from services outside of Cloudflare.
