## Workers KV completes hybrid storage provider rollout for improved performance, fault-tolerance

Workers KV has completed rolling out performance improvements across all KV namespaces, providing a significant latency reduction on read operations for all KV users. This is due to architectural changes to KV's underlying storage infrastructure, which introduces a new metadata later and substantially improves redundancy.

#### Performance improvements

The new hybrid architecture delivers substantial latency reductions throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa regions. Over the past 2 weeks, we have observed the following:

  * **p95 latency** : Reduced from ~150ms to ~50ms (67% decrease)
  * **p99 latency** : Reduced from ~350ms to ~250ms (29% decrease)
