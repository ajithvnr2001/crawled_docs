## Run more headless browsers concurrently with Browser Run

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/)

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/) lets you automate headless browsers on Cloudflare's global network. Run full browser sessions for interactive workflows, or use [Quick Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) for one-request tasks such as screenshots, PDFs, and capturing page content.

If you are on the [Workers Paid plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/), your default [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/#workers-paid) are now higher:

Limit | Previous | New  
---|---|---  
Concurrent browsers | 120 | **200**  
New browser instances / second | 1 | **3**  
Quick Actions requests / second | 10 | **30**  
  
You can now run hundreds of browser sessions in parallel, launch new browsers faster, and process three times as many [Quick Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) per second. These published limits are defaults, not maximums. If your workload needs more more concurrent browsers, [request higher limits ↗︎](https://forms.gle/CdueDKvb26mTaepa9).
