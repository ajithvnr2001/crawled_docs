A new Beta release for the macOS Cloudflare One Client is now available on the [beta releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/).

This beta release includes the following changes and improvements:

  * Improved connection reliability: the client now swaps protocol order after repeated connectivity-check failures, which helps when HTTP/3 is blocked after the QUIC handshake.
  * Fixed issue where a certificate error could be incorrectly displayed right after the connection is established.
  * A [DNS search domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#dns-search-suffixes) parsing failure no longer prevents connection.
  * Fixed a [MASQUE](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/settings/#device-tunnel-protocol) issue where the tunnel could stall while uploading at a high rate.
  * Fixed being unable to [switch organizations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/switch-organizations/) when the client was stuck in the "Device not in organization" state.
  * Fixed the Home Screen dropdown popup not anchoring correctly.
  * Fixed a crash during dialog dismissal.
  * Increased tolerance for configurations with a large number of [local domain fallback](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/local-domains/) resolver IPs, so DNS resolution behaves correctly even when more fallback resolvers are configured than recommended.
  * Fixed the WARP client stealing window focus (for example, during reauth).
  * Fixed a client crash when connecting to a captive portal over Wi-Fi.
  * Fixed the system tray icon showing "disconnected" while the UI showed "connected".
  * A successful re-authentication will cause the [device profile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/device-profiles/) to be re-evaluated.
  * Improved [dashboard-managed client updates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/deployment/mdm-deployment/client-version-assignments/) by running the updater only when needed.
