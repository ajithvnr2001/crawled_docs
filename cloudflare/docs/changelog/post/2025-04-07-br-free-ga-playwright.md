## Browser Rendering REST API is Generally Available, with new endpoints and a free tier

We’re excited to announce Browser Rendering is now available on the [Workers Free plan ↗︎](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/developer-platform/), making it even easier to prototype and experiment with web search and headless browser use-cases when building applications on Workers.

The Browser Rendering **[REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) is now Generally Available**, allowing you to control browser instances from outside of Workers applications. We've added three new endpoints to help automate more browser tasks:

  * **Extract structured data** – Use `/json` to retrieve structured data from a webpage.
  * **Retrieve links** – Use `/links` to pull all links from a webpage.
  * **Convert to Markdown** – Use `/markdown` to convert webpage content into Markdown format.



For example, to fetch the Markdown representation of a webpage:

Markdown examplebash
    
    
    curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<accountId>/browser-rendering/markdown' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <apiToken>' \
      -d '{
        "url": "https://example.com"
      }'

For the full list of endpoints, check out our [REST API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/). You can also interact with Browser Rendering via the [Cloudflare TypeScript SDK ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-typescript).

We also recently landed support for [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/playwright/) in Browser Rendering for browser automation from Cloudflare [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), in addition to [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/puppeteer/), giving you more flexibility to test across different browser environments.

Visit the [Browser Rendering docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/) to learn more about how to use headless browsers in your applications.
