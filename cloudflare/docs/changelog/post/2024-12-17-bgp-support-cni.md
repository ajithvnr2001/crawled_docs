Magic WAN and Magic Transit customers can use the Cloudflare dashboard to configure and manage BGP peering between their networks and their Magic routing table when using a Direct CNI on-ramp.

Using BGP peering allows customers to:

  * Automate the process of adding or removing networks and subnets.
  * Take advantage of failure detection and session recovery features.



With this functionality, customers can:

  * Establish an eBGP session between their devices and the Magic WAN / Magic Transit service when connected via CNI.
  * Secure the session by MD5 authentication to prevent misconfigurations.
  * Exchange routes dynamically between their devices and their Magic routing table.



Refer to [Magic WAN BGP peering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes) or [Magic Transit BGP peering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/how-to/configure-routes/#configure-bgp-routes) to learn more about this feature and how to set it up.
