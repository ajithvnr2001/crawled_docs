## D1 migrations support nested layouts via `migrations_pattern`

You can now point `wrangler d1 migrations apply` at a nested migrations layout — such as the one produced by [Drizzle ↗︎](https://orm.drizzle.team/) (`migrations/0001_init/migration.sql`) — using the new `migrations_pattern` D1 binding config:
    
    
    {
    	"d1_databases": [
    		{
    			"binding": "DB",
    			"database_name": "my-database",
    			"database_id": "<UUID>",
    			"migrations_dir": "migrations",
    			"migrations_pattern": "migrations/*/migration.sql",
    		},
    	],
    }

`migrations_pattern` is a glob (relative to your Wrangler config file) used to discover migration files. It defaults to `${migrations_dir}/*.sql`, so existing projects keep working unchanged. Each migration's name is recorded in the migrations table as a path relative to `migrations_dir`.
