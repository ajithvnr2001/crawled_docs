## Origin Content Signals for Markdown for Agents

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[Markdown for Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/markdown-for-agents/) now preserves security- and cache-relevant response headers from your origin when converting HTML to Markdown:

  * Markdown for Agents preserves security headers such as `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP), `X-Frame-Options`, `Set-Cookie`, and CORS headers (for example, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) on the converted response.
  * Caching headers (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`, `Age`) continue to pass through.



Your origin's [Content Signals ↗︎](https://contentsignals.org/) policy is now authoritative. If your origin sets a `content-signal` header, Markdown for Agents preserves it. When the origin does not send one, Cloudflare adds the default `Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes`.

This release also fixes relative link resolution for directory-style base URLs (those ending in a trailing slash). Previously, relative links such as `../page/` could resolve one path segment too high and return a `404`. Links are now resolved correctly per [RFC 3986 ↗︎](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-5.2.3).

Refer to our [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/markdown-for-agents/) for more details.
