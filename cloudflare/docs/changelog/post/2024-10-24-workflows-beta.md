Workflows is now in open beta, and available to any developer a free or paid Workers plan.

Workflows allow you to build multi-step applications that can automatically retry, persist state and run for minutes, hours, days, or weeks. Workflows introduces a programming model that makes it easier to build reliable, long-running tasks, observe as they progress, and programmatically trigger instances based on events across your services.

#### Get started

You can get started with Workflows by [following our get started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/get-started/guide/) and/or using `npm create cloudflare` to pull down the starter project:
    
    
    npm create cloudflare@latest workflows-starter -- --template "cloudflare/workflows-starter"

You can open the `src/index.ts` file, extend it, and use `wrangler deploy` to deploy your first Workflow. From there, you can:

  * Learn the [Workflows API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/)
  * [Trigger Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/trigger-workflows/) via your Workers apps.
  * Understand the [Rules of Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/rules-of-workflows/) and how to adopt best practices
