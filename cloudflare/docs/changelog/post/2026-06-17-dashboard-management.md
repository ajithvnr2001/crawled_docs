## Manage Artifacts from the Cloudflare dashboard

[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can now configure [Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/how-artifacts-works/) namespaces, repos, and tokens directly from the Cloudflare dashboard.

Artifacts is Git-compatible storage that lets you store repos on Cloudflare and interact with them using standard Git workflows.

You can view and create [namespaces](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/concepts/namespaces/#use-namespaces-as-containers), which are top-level containers for repos:

You can view, create, fork, and search repos within a namespace:

You can open a repo to view its files and copy its Git remote URL.

You can also provision tokens directly from the dashboard to scope Git access to a single repo, with read tokens for clone, fetch, and pull workflows, or write tokens when a client needs to push changes.

To get started, go to the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and select **Storage & databases** > **Artifacts**.

If you are enrolled in the Artifacts beta, you can use the dashboard to set up Artifacts. If you would like to join the beta, complete the [request form ↗︎](https://forms.gle/DwBoPRa3CWQ8ajFp7).
