## Increased limits for Queues pull consumers

[Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/)

[Queues pull consumers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pull-consumers/) can now pull and acknowledge up to **5,000 messages / second per queue**. Previously, pull consumers were rate limited to 1,200 requests / 5 minutes, aggregated across all queues.

Pull consumers allow you to consume messages over HTTP from any environment—including outside of [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers). They’re also useful when you need fine-grained control over how quickly messages are consumed.

To setup a new queue with a pull based consumer using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), run:

Create a queue with a pull based consumersh
    
    
    npx wrangler queues create my-queue
    npx wrangler queues consumer http add my-queue

You can also configure a pull consumer using the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/queues/subresources/consumers/methods/create/) or the Queues dashboard.

Once configured, you can pull messages from the queue using any HTTP client. You'll need a [Cloudflare API Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) with `queues_read` and `queues_write` permissions. For example:

Pull messages from a queuebash
    
    
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${CF_ACCOUNT_ID}/queues/${QUEUE_ID}/messages/pull" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_TOKEN}" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{ "visibility_timeout": 10000, "batch_size": 2 }'

To learn more about how to acknowledge messages, pull batches at once, and setup multiple consumers, refer to the [pull consumer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pull-consumers).

As always, Queues doesn't charge for data egress. Pull operations continue to be billed at the [existing rate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/pricing), of $0.40 / million operations. The increased limits are available now, on all new and existing queues. If you're new to Queues, [get started with the Cloudflare Queues guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started).
