Real-time Tunnel log streaming is now available in the Cloudflare dashboard under **Networking** > **Tunnels**. This brings the same live debugging capability previously only available in the Cloudflare One dashboard, including multi-connector aggregated streaming for high-availability deployments.

In the tunnel detail view, a new **Live logs** tab lets you:

  * **Stream logs from single or multiple connectors** — In [highly available](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/configuration/#replicas-and-high-availability) deployments with multiple `cloudflared` replicas, logs from all connectors are merged into a single stream grouped by hostname, making it easy to identify which host machine produced each log entry.
  * **Filter by log level, event type, and HTTP method** — Narrow the stream to only the events you care about (HTTP, TCP, UDP, or `cloudflared` internal), at any log level.
