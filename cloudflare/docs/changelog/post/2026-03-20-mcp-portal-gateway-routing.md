## Route MCP server portal traffic through Cloudflare Gateway

[MCP server portals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/) can now route traffic through [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/) for richer HTTP request logging and data loss prevention (DLP) scanning.

When Gateway routing is turned on, portal traffic appears in your [Gateway HTTP logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/gateway-logs/). You can create [Gateway HTTP policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/) with [DLP profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/) to detect and block sensitive data sent to upstream MCP servers.

Note

DLP [AI prompt profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles/#ai-prompt) do not apply to MCP server portal traffic.

To enable Gateway routing, go to **Access controls** > **AI controls** , edit the portal, and turn on **Route traffic through Cloudflare Gateway** under **Basic information**.
