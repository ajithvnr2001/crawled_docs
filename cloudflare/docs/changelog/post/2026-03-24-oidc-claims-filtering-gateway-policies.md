## OIDC Claims filtering now available in Gateway Firewall, Resolver, and Egress policies

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

Cloudflare Gateway now supports [OIDC Claims](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/identity-selectors/#oidc-claims) as a selector in Firewall, Resolver, and Egress policies. Administrators can use custom OIDC claims from their identity provider to build fine-grained, identity-based traffic policies across all Gateway policy types.

With this update, you can:

  * Filter traffic in [DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/dns-policies/), [HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/), and [Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/) firewall policies based on OIDC claim values.
  * Apply custom [resolver policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/resolver-policies/) to route DNS queries to specific resolvers depending on a user's OIDC claims.
  * Control [egress policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/egress-policies/) to assign dedicated egress IPs based on OIDC claim attributes.



For example, you can create a policy that routes traffic differently for users with `department=engineering` in their OIDC claims, or restrict access to certain destinations based on a user's role claim.

To get started, configure [custom OIDC claims](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/generic-oidc/#custom-oidc-claims) on your identity provider and use the **OIDC Claims** selector in the Gateway policy builder.

For more information, refer to [Identity-based policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/identity-selectors/).
