## Workflows is now Generally Available

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) is now _Generally Available_ (or "GA"): in short, it's ready for production workloads. Alongside marking Workflows as GA, we've introduced a number of changes during the beta period, including:

  * A new `waitForEvent` API that allows a Workflow to wait for an event to occur before continuing execution.
  * Increased concurrency: you can [run up to 4,500 Workflow instances](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-02-25-workflows-concurrency-increased/) concurrently — and this will continue to grow.
  * Improved observability, including new CPU time metrics that allow you to better understand which Workflow instances are consuming the most resources and/or contributing to your bill.
  * Support for `vitest` for testing Workflows locally and in CI/CD pipelines.



Workflows also supports the new [increased CPU limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2025-03-25-higher-cpu-limits/) that apply to Workers, allowing you to run more CPU-intensive tasks (up to 5 minutes of CPU time per instance), not including the time spent waiting on network calls, AI models, or other I/O bound tasks.

#### Human-in-the-loop

The new `step.waitForEvent` API allows a Workflow instance to wait on events and data, enabling human-in-the-the-loop interactions, such as approving or rejecting a request, directly handling webhooks from other systems, or pushing event data to a Workflow while it's running.

Because Workflows are just code, you can conditionally execute code based on the result of a `waitForEvent` call, and/or call `waitForEvent` multiple times in a single Workflow based on what the Workflow needs.

For example, if you wanted to implement a human-in-the-loop approval process, you could use `waitForEvent` to wait for a user to approve or reject a request, and then conditionally execute code based on the result.
    
    
    import {
    	WorkflowEntrypoint,
    	WorkflowStep,
    	WorkflowEvent,
    } from "cloudflare:workers";
    
    export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
    	async run(event, step) {
    		// Other steps in your Workflow
    		let stripeEvent = await step.waitForEvent(
    			"receive invoice paid webhook from Stripe",
    			{ type: "stripe-webhook", timeout: "1 hour" },
    		);
    		// Rest of your Workflow
    	}
    }
    
    
    import { WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkflowStep, WorkflowEvent } from "cloudflare:workers";
    
    export class MyWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
    	async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    		// Other steps in your Workflow
    		let stripeEvent = await step.waitForEvent<IncomingStripeWebhook>("receive invoice paid webhook from Stripe", { type: "stripe-webhook", timeout: "1 hour" })
    		// Rest of your Workflow
    	}
    }

You can then send a Workflow an event from an external service via HTTP or from within a Worker using the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/) for Workflows:
    
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(req, env) {
    		const instanceId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("instanceId");
    		const webhookPayload = await req.json();
    
    		let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(instanceId);
    		// Send our event, with `type` matching the event type defined in
    		// our step.waitForEvent call
    		await instance.sendEvent({
    			type: "stripe-webhook",
    			payload: webhookPayload,
    		});
    
    		return Response.json({
    			status: await instance.status(),
    		});
    	},
    };
    
    
    export default {
      async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
        const instanceId = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("instanceId")
        const webhookPayload = await req.json<Payload>()
    
        let instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get(instanceId);
        // Send our event, with `type` matching the event type defined in
        // our step.waitForEvent call
        await instance.sendEvent({type: "stripe-webhook", payload: webhookPayload})
    
        return Response.json({
          status: await instance.status(),
        });
      },
    };
