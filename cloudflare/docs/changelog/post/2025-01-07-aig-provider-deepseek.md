With this addition, you have even more flexibility to manage and optimize your AI workloads using AI Gateway. Whether you're leveraging DeepSeek or other providers, like OpenAI, Anthropic, or [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/), AI Gateway empowers you to:

  * **Monitor** : Gain actionable insights with analytics and logs.
  * **Control** : Implement caching, rate limiting, and fallbacks.
  * **Optimize** : Improve performance with feedback and evaluations.

To get started, simply update the base URL of your DeepSeek API calls to route through AI Gateway. Here's how you can send a request using cURL:

Example fetch requestbash
    
    
    curl https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/deepseek/chat/completions \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer DEEPSEEK_TOKEN' \
     --data '{
        "model": "deepseek-chat",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What is Cloudflare?"
            }
        ]
    }'
