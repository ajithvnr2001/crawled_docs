## Manage AI Search sync jobs with Wrangler CLI

[AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

When you connect a [data source](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/data-source/) to your [AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/) instance, AI Search runs sync jobs to keep your index up to date with your content. You can now manage those jobs directly from [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/wrangler-commands/).

For example, you can trigger a sync job from your CI/CD or automated pipelines with the `jobs create` command so your index refreshes when you push a change:
    
    
    wrangler ai-search jobs create my-instance

This creates an asynchronous sync job that checks for changes in your data source, and sends new, modified, or deleted files to be indexed. The following commands are available:

Command | Description  
---|---  
`wrangler ai-search jobs create` | Trigger a new sync job  
`wrangler ai-search jobs list` | List sync jobs for an instance  
`wrangler ai-search jobs get` | Get details for a job  
`wrangler ai-search jobs cancel` | Cancel a running job  
`wrangler ai-search jobs logs` | View log entries for a job  
  
All commands accept `--namespace`/`-n` (defaults to `default`) and `--json` for structured output that automation and AI agents can parse directly. The `list` and `logs` commands also support `--page` and `--per-page` for pagination, and `cancel` prompts for confirmation unless you pass `-y`/`--force`.

For full usage details, refer to the [AI Search Wrangler commands documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/wrangler-commands/).
