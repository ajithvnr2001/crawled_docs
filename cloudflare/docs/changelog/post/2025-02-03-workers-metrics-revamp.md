## Revamped Workers Metrics

We've revamped the [Workers Metrics dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/services/view/:worker/production/metrics/).

Now you can easily compare metrics across Worker versions, understand the current state of a [gradual deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), and review key Workers metrics in a single view. This new interface enables you to:

  * Drag-and-select using a graphical timepicker for precise metric selection.

  * Use histograms to visualize cumulative metrics, allowing you to bucket and compare rates over time.
  * Focus on Worker versions by directly interacting with the version numbers in the legend.

  * Monitor and compare active gradual deployments.
  * Track error rates across versions with grouping both by version and by invocation status.
  * Measure how [Smart Placement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/placement/) improves request duration.
