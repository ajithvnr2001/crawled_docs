[MCP server portals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/) are now generally available to all Cloudflare customers. A portal gives users one endpoint for approved Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Cloudflare Access logs tool, prompt, and resource activity.

Since the open beta, MCP server portals have added:

  * [Gateway routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/#route-portal-traffic-through-gateway) for HTTP logging and data loss prevention (DLP) scanning
  * [Code Mode policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/#code-mode-policies) that control how portals reduce tool definitions and token use
  * [Static OAuth client credentials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/#configure-manual-oauth-credentials) for providers that do not support Dynamic Client Registration
  * [Session management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/#manage-portal-sessions) for reconnecting servers and changing authorizations from the portal
  * [Service token authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/#connect-with-a-service-token) for autonomous agents and machine-to-machine access
  * [Logpush support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/) for exporting portal activity to external storage or a security information and event management (SIEM) system
