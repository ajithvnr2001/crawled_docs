## Increased static asset limits for Workers

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/)

You can now upload up to **100,000 static assets** per Worker version

  * Paid and Workers for Platforms users can now upload up to **100,000 static assets** per Worker version, a 5x increase from the previous limit of 20,000.
  * Customers on the free plan still have the same limit as before — 20,000 static assets per version of your Worker
  * The individual file size limit of 25 MiB remains unchanged for all customers.



This increase allows you to build larger applications with more static assets without hitting limits.

#### Wrangler

To take advantage of the increased limits, you must use **Wrangler version 4.34.0 or higher**. Earlier versions of Wrangler will continue to enforce the previous 20,000 file limit.
