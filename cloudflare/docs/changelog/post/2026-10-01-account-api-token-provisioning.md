## Account members can self-serve create Account API tokens

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)

Account API token creation is no longer limited to Super Administrators. Members with the **API Token Provisioning** role can now create Account API tokens via the Dashboard, API, Terraform, or CF CLI, making it easier for developers and platform teams to provision credentials without depending on a Super Administrator for Account API Token Provisioning.

#### What's new

  * **Delegated creation** : Members with the **API Token Provisioning** role can create Account API tokens from the dashboard. Administrators can grant this role through the dashboard, API, or Terraform.
  * **OAuth support for token creation** : OAuth clients that request the `account_api_tokens:create` scope, starting with Cloudflare CLI, can create Account API tokens.
  * **Account API token permissions limited to the creator’s access at creation time** : Members can only create an Account API Token using the permissions they already have. For OAuth-created tokens, permissions are also limited to the scopes granted during authorization.
  * **Creator attribution and visibility** : Account API tokens now include creator metadata. Super Administrators and Administrators can view all Account API tokens in an account, while members with the **API Token Provisioning** role can only view tokens they created.
