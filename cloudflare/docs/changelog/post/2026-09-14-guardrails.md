## Control which hostnames Browser Run sessions can access

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/)

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/) now supports [guardrails](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/guardrails/), which limit a browser session's HTTP and HTTPS requests to permitted hostnames.

Use guardrails when you need to:

  * Keep a browser workflow limited to a specific website and its subdomains.
  * Load only known third-party APIs, scripts, images, and fonts.
  * Generate a screenshot or PDF from HTML you provide while preventing it from loading external content.



Set guardrails when starting a session with Puppeteer, Playwright, or the REST API. With a browser binding named `MYBROWSER`, pass `guardrails` when launching Puppeteer:
    
    
    import puppeteer from "@cloudflare/puppeteer";
    
    export async function startGuardedSession(env) {
    	return puppeteer.launch(env.MYBROWSER, {
    		guardrails: {
    			allowedDomains: ["example.com", "*.example.com"],
    		},
    	});
    }
    
    
    import puppeteer from "@cloudflare/puppeteer";
    
    interface Env {
    	MYBROWSER: Fetcher;
    }
    
    export async function startGuardedSession(env: Env) {
    	return puppeteer.launch(env.MYBROWSER, {
    		guardrails: {
    			allowedDomains: ["example.com", "*.example.com"],
    		},
    	});
    }

In addition to session guardrails, Browser Run now supports a read-only mode for [Live View](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/live-view/). Live View lets you watch and interact with an active Browser Run session in real time. A read-only link lets someone watch without clicking, typing, navigating, or running JavaScript.

To create a read-only link, set `{ mode: "readonly" }` when generating the Live View URL. This setting affects only the person using that link. The session's hostname restrictions remain unchanged.

Refer to the [guardrails documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/guardrails/) for more information.
