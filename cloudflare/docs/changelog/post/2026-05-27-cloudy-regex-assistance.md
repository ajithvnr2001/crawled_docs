## Write regex using natural language in Cloudflare One

[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

[Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/) policy selectors which support regular expressions can now be authored in the dashboard using natural language. When building a [policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/expression-syntax/) with a regex-based selector (like `matches regex`), you can describe what you want to match in plain English and the Cloudflare Agent will generate and validate a corresponding regular expression.

![Write policy regex using natural language](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1000,height=638,format=webp/_astro/gateway-regex-ai-generation.CtJ0S6FS.png)

To get started, select a regex-compatible selector in the [Gateway policy builder](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/) and select the icon. You'll see an input field for natural language, such as "any URL starting with /api/v1" or ".com, .net, and .app hosts which contain `gooogle` in the host."

You can also use the tool to explain existing regular expressions. If a policy already contains a regex pattern, you can instantly generate a plain-language description.

A built-in feedback mechanism allows you to rate each interaction to help improve output quality over time.

For more information, refer to [Cloudflare One firewall policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/) and expect to see the same functionality supported soon in [Data loss prevention profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/).
