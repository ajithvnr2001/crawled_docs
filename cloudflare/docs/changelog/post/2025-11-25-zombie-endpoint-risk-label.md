## New Zombie API detection for API Shield

[API Shield](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/)

API Shield now automatically detects zombie endpoints — saved endpoints that have not received traffic for an extended period. When detected, the `cf-risk-zombie` [risk label](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/#risk-labels) is applied.

The scan runs daily alongside existing risk scans. Endpoints are labeled after 32 days without traffic.

Zombie endpoints may indicate deprecated or forgotten API surface area that could pose a security risk. Review these endpoints and consider removing them from Endpoint Management if they are no longer in use. Also consider using a [fallthrough rule](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/#add-validation-by-adding-a-fallthrough-rule) to prevent communication with endpoints removed from Endpoint Management.
