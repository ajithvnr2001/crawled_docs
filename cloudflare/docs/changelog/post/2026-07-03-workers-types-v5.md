## Simpler runtime types with @cloudflare/workers-types v5

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

We have released version 5 of [`@cloudflare/workers-types` ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-types). This release simplifies the package to expose only the latest runtime types.

We still recommend that you generate types for your Worker using [`wrangler types`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#types), but if you want to use the package directly, you can install it with your package manager of choice:

npmyarnpnpmbun
    
    
    npm i -D @cloudflare/workers-types@latest
    
    
    yarn add -D @cloudflare/workers-types@latest
    
    
    pnpm add -D @cloudflare/workers-types@latest
    
    
    bun add -d @cloudflare/workers-types@latest

The package now exposes two entrypoints:

  * `@cloudflare/workers-types` reflects the latest compatibility date, using the latest stable compatibility flags.
  * `@cloudflare/workers-types/experimental` reflects APIs behind experimental compatibility flags.



The dated entrypoints, such as `@cloudflare/workers-types/2022-11-30` and `@cloudflare/workers-types/2023-03-01`, are removed. With runtime type generation in [Wrangler v4](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), you can generate these with the `wrangler types` command to create types locked to your Worker's compatibility date.

For more information, refer to [TypeScript language support](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/).
