#### Enhanced HTTP/3 request cancellation visibility

Cloudflare now provides more accurate visibility into HTTP/3 client request cancellations, giving you better insight into real client behavior and reducing unnecessary load on your origins.

Previously, when an HTTP/3 client cancelled a request, the cancellation was not always actioned immediately. This meant requests could continue through the CDN — potentially all the way to your origin — even after the client had abandoned them. In these cases, logs would show the upstream response status (such as `200` or a timeout-related code) rather than reflecting the client cancellation.

Now, Cloudflare terminates cancelled HTTP/3 requests immediately and accurately logs them with a `499` status code.

#### Better observability for client behavior

When HTTP/3 clients cancel requests, Cloudflare now immediately reflects this in your logs with a `499` status code. This gives you:

  * **More accurate traffic analysis** : Understand exactly when and how often clients cancel requests.
  * **Clearer debugging** : Distinguish between true errors and intentional client cancellations.
  * **Better availability metrics** : Separate client-initiated cancellations from server-side issues.

#### Reduced origin load

Cloudflare now terminates cancelled requests faster, which means:

  * **Less wasted compute** : Your origin no longer processes requests that clients have already abandoned.
  * **Lower bandwidth usage** : Responses are no longer generated and transmitted for cancelled requests.
  * **Improved efficiency** : Resources are freed up to handle active requests.

#### What to expect in your logs

You may notice an increase in `499` status codes for HTTP/3 traffic. For HTTP/3, a `499` indicates the client [cancelled the request stream ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#section-4.1.1) before receiving a complete response — the underlying connection may remain open. This is a normal part of web traffic.

**Tip** : If you use `499` codes in availability calculations, consider whether client-initiated cancellations should be excluded from error rates. These typically represent normal user behavior — such as closing a browser, navigating away from a page, mobile network drops, or cancelling a download — rather than service issues.
