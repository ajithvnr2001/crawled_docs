## Connect multiple clients to one Browser Run session

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/)

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/) sessions now accept multiple concurrent connections. Before, a session accepted only one connection at a time, and other Workers had to wait until that connection closed. Now multiple Workers can connect to the same browser at the same time.

Each `puppeteer.connect()` call opens its own Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) connection. Create a separate browser context for each request to keep its pages, cookies, and storage apart from other clients.
    
    
    const browser = await puppeteer.connect(env.MYBROWSER, sessionId);
    const context = await browser.createBrowserContext();
    
    try {
    	const page = await context.newPage();
    	await page.goto("https://example.com");
    	// ...
    } finally {
    	await context.close();
    	await browser.disconnect(); // keep the shared browser running
    }
    
    
    const browser = await puppeteer.connect(env.MYBROWSER, sessionId);
    const context = await browser.createBrowserContext();
    
    try {
    	const page = await context.newPage();
    	await page.goto("https://example.com");
    	// ...
    } finally {
    	await context.close();
    	await browser.disconnect(); // keep the shared browser running
    }

Sharing sessions means fewer new browsers to launch, less cold-start time, and fewer [concurrent browsers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/) counted against your limits.

Concurrent connections require `@cloudflare/puppeteer` version 1.1.0 or later.

Refer to [Reuse sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/features/reuse-sessions/) for a full example.
