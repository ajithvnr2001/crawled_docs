## Run and connect Workers in separate dev commands with the Cloudflare Vite plugin

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Workers can now talk to each other across separate dev commands using service bindings and tail consumers, whether started with `vite dev` or `wrangler dev`.

Simply start each Worker in its own terminal:
    
    
    # Terminal 1
    vite dev
    
    # Terminal 2
    wrangler dev

This is useful when different teams maintain different Workers, or when each Worker has its own build setup or tooling.

Check out the [Developing with multiple Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/local-development/multi-workers) guide to learn more about the different approaches and when to use each one.
