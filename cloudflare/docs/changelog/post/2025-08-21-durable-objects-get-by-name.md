## New getByName() API to access Durable Objects

You can now create a client (a [Durable Object stub](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/stub/)) to a Durable Object with the new `getByName` method, removing the need to convert Durable Object names to IDs and then create a stub.
    
    
    // Before: (1) translate name to ID then (2) get a client 
    const objectId = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.idFromName("foo"); // or .newUniqueId()
    const stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.get(objectId); 
    
    // Now: retrieve client to Durable Object directly via its name 
    const stub = env.MY_DURABLE_OBJECT.getByName("foo");
    
    // Use client to send request to the remote Durable Object
    const rpcResponse = await stub.sayHello();

Each Durable Object has a globally-unique name, which allows you to send requests to a specific object from anywhere in the world. Thus, a Durable Object can be used to coordinate between multiple clients who need to work together. You can have billions of Durable Objects, providing isolation between application tenants.
