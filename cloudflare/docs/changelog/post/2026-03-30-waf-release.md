This week's release introduces new detections for a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in Fortinet products (CVE-2025-59718), alongside three new generic detection rules designed to identify and block HTTP Parameter Pollution attempts. Additionally, this release includes targeted protection for a high-impact unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Magento and Adobe Commerce.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2025-59718: An improper cryptographic signature verification vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager. This may allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass the FortiCloud SSO login authentication using a maliciously crafted SAML message, if that feature is enabled on the device.

  * Magento 2 - Unrestricted File Upload: A critical flaw in Magento and Adobe Commerce allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security checks and upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).




**Impact**

Successful exploitation of the Fortinet and Magento vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to gain administrative control or deploy webshells, leading to complete server compromise and data theft.
