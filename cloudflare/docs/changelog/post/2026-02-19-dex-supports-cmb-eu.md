## DEX Supports EU Customer Metadata Boundary

[Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/dex/) provides visibility into [WARP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/) device connectivity and performance to any internal or external application.

Now, all DEX logs are fully compatible with Cloudflare's [Customer Metadata Boundary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/metadata-boundary/) (CMB) setting for the 'EU' (European Union), which ensures that DEX logs will not be stored outside the 'EU' when the option is configured.

If a Cloudflare One customer using DEX enables CMB 'EU', they will not see any DEX data in the Cloudflare One dashboard. Customers can ingest DEX data via [LogPush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/), and build their own analytics and dashboards.

If a customer enables CMB in their account, they will see the following message in the Digital Experience dashboard: "DEX data is unavailable because Customer Metadata Boundary configuration is on. Use Cloudflare LogPush to export DEX datasets."
