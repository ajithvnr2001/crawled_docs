## New CPU Pricing for Containers and Sandboxes

[Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/)

[Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/) and [Sandboxes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) pricing for CPU time is now based on active usage only, instead of provisioned resources.

This means that you now pay less for Containers and Sandboxes.

#### An Example Before and After

Imagine running the `standard-2` instance type for one hour, which can use up to 1 vCPU, but on average you use only 20% of your CPU capacity.

CPU-time is priced at _$0.00002 per vCPU-second_.

Previously, you would be charged for the CPU allocated to the instance multiplied by the time it was active, in this case 1 hour.

CPU cost would have been: **$0.072** — 1 vCPU * 3600 seconds * $0.00002

Now, since you are only using 20% of your CPU capacity, your CPU cost is cut to 20% of the previous amount.

CPU cost is now: **$0.0144** — 1 vCPU * 3600 seconds * $0.00002 * 20% utilization

This can significantly reduce costs for Containers and Sandboxes.

Note

Memory cost and disk pricing remain unchanged, and is still calculated based on _provisioned_ resources.
