You can now monitor the total SQLite storage used by a Durable Object namespace over time in the Cloudflare dashboard. The new **Total storage** chart shows the maximum storage reported during each hour. This helps you identify storage growth, validate data cleanup, and investigate unexpected usage.

![The Total storage chart showing a Durable Object namespace growing to 260.1 MB of storage over time.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1436,height=846,format=webp/_astro/durable-objects-total-storage.Cr_F72Yz.png)[ Go to **Durable Objects** ↗ ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/durable-objects)

The chart appears only for SQLite-backed Durable Object namespaces. It does not appear for namespaces that use the legacy key-value storage backend. Viewing storage for individual Durable Objects by ID or name is not supported.
