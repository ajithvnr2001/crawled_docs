## Streamlined clientless browser isolation for private applications

A new **Allow clientless access** setting makes it easier to connect users without a device client to internal applications, without using public DNS.

Previously, to provide clientless access to a private hostname or IP without a [published application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/routes/add-routes/#add-a-published-application-route), you had to create a separate [bookmark application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/bookmarks/) pointing to a prefixed [Clientless Web Isolation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/) URL (for example, `https://<your-teamname>.cloudflareaccess.com/browser/https://10.0.0.1/`). This bookmark was visible to all users in the App Launcher, regardless of whether they had access to the underlying application.

Now, you can manage clientless access directly within your [private self-hosted application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/self-hosted-private-app/). When **Allow clientless access** is turned on, users who pass your Access application policies will see a tile in their App Launcher pointing to the prefixed URL. Users must have [remote browser permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/) to open the link.
