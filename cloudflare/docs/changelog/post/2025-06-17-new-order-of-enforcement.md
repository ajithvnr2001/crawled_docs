## Gateway will now evaluate Network policies before HTTP policies from July 14th, 2025

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/) will now evaluate [Network (Layer 4) policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/) **before** [HTTP (Layer 7) policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/). This change preserves your existing security posture and does not affect which traffic is filtered — but it may impact how notifications are displayed to end users.

This change will roll out progressively between **July 14–18, 2025**. If you use HTTP policies, we recommend reviewing your configuration ahead of rollout to ensure the user experience remains consistent.

#### Updated order of enforcement

**Previous order:**

  1. DNS policies
  2. HTTP policies
  3. Network policies



**New order:**

  1. DNS policies
  2. **Network policies**
  3. **HTTP policies**



#### Action required: Review your Gateway HTTP policies

This change may affect block notifications. For example:

  * You have an **HTTP policy** to block `example.com` and display a block page.
  * You also have a **Network policy** to block `example.com` silently (no client notification).



With the new order, the Network policy will trigger first — and the user will no longer see the HTTP block page.

To ensure users still receive a block notification, you can:

  * Add a client notification to your Network policy, or
  * Use only the HTTP policy for that domain.



* * *

#### Why we’re making this change

This update is based on user feedback and aims to:

  * Create a more intuitive model by evaluating network-level policies before application-level policies.
  * Minimize [526 connection errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-526/#error-526-in-the-zero-trust-context) by verifying the network path to an origin before attempting to establish a decrypted TLS connection.
