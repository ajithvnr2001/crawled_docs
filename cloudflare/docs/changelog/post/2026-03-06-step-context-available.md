## Workflow steps now expose retry attempt number via step context

Cloudflare Workflows allows you to configure specific retry logic for each step in your workflow execution. Now, you can access **which** retry attempt is currently executing for calls to `step.do()`:
    
    
    await step.do("my-step", async (ctx) => {
    	// ctx.attempt is 1 on first try, 2 on first retry, etc.
    	console.log(`Attempt ${ctx.attempt}`);
    });

You can use the step context for improved logging & observability, progressive backoff, or conditional logic in your workflow definition.

Note that the current attempt number is 1-indexed. For more information on retry behavior, refer to [Sleeping and Retrying](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/sleeping-and-retrying/).
