## Stream logs from multiple replicas of Cloudflare Tunnel simultaneously

In the Cloudflare One dashboard, the overview page for a specific Cloudflare Tunnel now shows all [replicas](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/configure-tunnels/tunnel-availability/) of that tunnel and supports streaming logs from multiple replicas at once.

Previously, you could only stream logs from one replica at a time. With this update:

  * **Replicas on the tunnel overview** — All active replicas for the selected tunnel now appear on that tunnel's overview page under **Connectors**. Select any replica to stream its logs.
  * **Multi-connector log streaming** — Stream logs from multiple replicas simultaneously, making it easier to correlate events across your infrastructure during debugging or incident response. To try it out, log in to [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) and go to **Networks** > **Connectors** > **Cloudflare Tunnels**. Select **View logs** next to the tunnel you want to monitor.
