## Updated Workers AI popularity metric in Cloudflare Radar

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) has changed how it measures [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) model and task popularity.

Previously, popularity was based on the number of unique accounts running inferences against each model or task. It is now based on the **number of inferences** , giving a more representative view of actual usage volume. This change will affect all new measurements as well as historical data. As a result, the model and task distributions shown on Radar may differ from what you saw previously, and historical trends may shift accordingly.

The [Workers AI model popularity ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights#workers-ai-model-popularity) chart shows the distribution of inferences across models.

The [Workers AI task popularity ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights#workers-ai-task-popularity) chart shows the distribution of inferences across tasks.

The same data is available via the following API endpoints:

  * [`/ai/inference/summary/{dimension}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/ai/subresources/inference/methods/summary_v2/)
  * [`/ai/inference/timeseries_groups/{dimension}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/ai/subresources/inference/methods/timeseries_groups_v2/)
