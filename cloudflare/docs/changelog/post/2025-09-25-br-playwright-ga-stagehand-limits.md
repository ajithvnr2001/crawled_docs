## Browser Rendering Playwright GA, Stagehand support (Beta), and higher limits

[Browser Run](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

We’re shipping three updates to Browser Rendering:

  * Playwright support is now Generally Available and synced with [Playwright v1.55 ↗︎](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#version-155), giving you a stable foundation for critical automation and AI-agent workflows.
  * We’re also adding [Stagehand support (Beta)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/stagehand/) so you can combine code with natural language instructions to build more resilient automations.
  * Finally, we’ve tripled [limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/limits/#workers-paid) for paid plans across both the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/quick-actions/) and [Browser Sessions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/#integration-methods) to help you scale.



To get started with Stagehand, refer to the [Stagehand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/stagehand/) example that uses Stagehand and [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) to search for a movie on this [example movie directory ↗︎](https://demo.playwright.dev/movies), extract its details using natural language (title, year, rating, duration, and genre), and return the information along with a screenshot of the webpage.

Stagehand examplets
    
    
    const stagehand = new Stagehand({
    	env: "LOCAL",
    	localBrowserLaunchOptions: { cdpUrl: endpointURLString(env.BROWSER) },
    	llmClient: new WorkersAIClient(env.AI),
    	verbose: 1,
    });
    
    await stagehand.init();
    const page = stagehand.page;
    
    await page.goto("https://demo.playwright.dev/movies");
    
    // if search is a multi-step action, stagehand will return an array of actions it needs to act on
    const actions = await page.observe('Search for "Furiosa"');
    for (const action of actions) await page.act(action);
    
    await page.act("Click the search result");
    
    // normal playwright functions work as expected
    await page.waitForSelector(".info-wrapper .cast");
    
    let movieInfo = await page.extract({
    	instruction: "Extract movie information",
    	schema: z.object({
    		title: z.string(),
    		year: z.number(),
    		rating: z.number(),
    		genres: z.array(z.string()),
    		duration: z.number().describe("Duration in minutes"),
    	}),
    });
    
    await stagehand.close();
