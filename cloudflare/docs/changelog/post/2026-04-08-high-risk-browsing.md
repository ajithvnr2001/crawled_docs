## User risk scoring for high risk browsing activity

Cloudflare One's **User Risk Scoring** now incorporates direct signals from **Gateway DNS traffic patterns**. This update allows security teams to automatically elevate a user's risk score when they visit high-risk or malicious domains, providing a more holistic view of internal threats.

#### Why this matters

Browsing activity is a primary indicator of potential compromise. By tying Gateway DNS logs to specific users, administrators can now flag individuals interacting with:

  * **Security threats** : Domains associated with malware, phishing, or command-and-control (C2) centers.
  * **High-risk content** : Categories such as questionable content or violence that may violate corporate compliance.



Even if a Gateway policy is set to **Block** the traffic, the interaction is still captured as a "hit" to ensure the user's risk profile reflects the attempted activity.

#### New risk behaviors

Two new behaviors are now available in the dashboard:

  * **Suspicious Security Domain Visited** : Triggers when a user visits a domain in the security threats or security risk categories.
  * **High risk domain visited** : Triggers when a user visits domains categorized as questionable content, violence, or CIPA.
