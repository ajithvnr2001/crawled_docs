## URL Scanner improvements on Cloudflare Radar

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) ships several improvements to the [URL Scanner ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan) that make scan reports more informative and easier to share:

  * **Live screenshots** — the summary card now includes an option to capture a live screenshot of the scanned URL on demand using the [Browser Rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-run/) API.
  * **Save as PDF** — a new button generates a print-optimized document aggregating all tab contents (Summary, Security, Network, Behavior, and Indicators) into a single file.
  * **Download as JSON** — raw scan data is available as a JSON download for programmatic use.
  * **Redesigned summary layout** — page information and security details are now displayed side by side with the screenshot, with a layout that adapts to narrower viewports.
  * **File downloads** — downloads are separated into a dedicated card with expandable rows showing each file's source URL and SHA256 hash.
  * **Detailed IP address data** — the Network tab now includes additional detail per IP address observed during the scan.
