## Connect to remote databases during local development with wrangler dev

[Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/)

You can now connect directly to remote databases and databases requiring TLS with `wrangler dev`. This lets you run your Worker code locally while connecting to remote databases, without needing to use `wrangler dev --remote`.

The `localConnectionString` field and `CLOUDFLARE_HYPERDRIVE_LOCAL_CONNECTION_STRING_<BINDING_NAME>` environment variable can be used to configure the connection string used by `wrangler dev`.
    
    
    {
      "hyperdrive": [
        {
          "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
          "id": "your-hyperdrive-id",
          "localConnectionString": "postgres://user:password@remote-host.example.com:5432/database?sslmode=require"
        }
      ]
    }
