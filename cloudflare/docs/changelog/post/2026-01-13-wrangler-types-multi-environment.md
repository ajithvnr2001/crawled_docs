## `wrangler types` now generates types for all environments

The `wrangler types` command now generates TypeScript types for bindings from **all environments** defined in your Wrangler configuration file by default.

Previously, `wrangler types` only generated types for bindings in the top-level configuration (or a single environment when using the `--env` flag). This meant that if you had environment-specific bindings — for example, a KV namespace only in production or an R2 bucket only in staging — those bindings would be missing from your generated types, causing TypeScript errors when accessing them.

Now, running `wrangler types` collects bindings from all environments and includes them in the generated `Env` type. This ensures your types are complete regardless of which environment you deploy to.

#### Generating types for a specific environment

If you want the previous behavior of generating types for only a specific environment, you can use the `--env` flag:
    
    
    wrangler types --env production
