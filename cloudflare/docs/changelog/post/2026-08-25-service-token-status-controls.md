Cloudflare Access administrators can now temporarily turn off service tokens without deleting them. A disabled token cannot authenticate, but its configuration remains available so administrators can turn it on again later.

Turning off a token also stops any previous secret in an active rotation grace period. Use this control to contain suspected credential exposure or pause an automated service.

For configuration instructions, refer to [Turn a service token on or off](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/#turn-a-service-token-on-or-off).
