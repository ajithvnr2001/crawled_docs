You can create PlanetScale Postgres and MySQL databases from Cloudflare and bill PlanetScale database usage through your Cloudflare account as a pay-as-you-go customer. Cloudflare contract customers will be able to add PlanetScale usage to their contract in July so reach out to your Cloudflare account team if interested.

Create a PlanetScale database from the Cloudflare dashboard to check out globally distributed Workers optimized for regional data access.

[ Go to **Create a PlanetScale database** ↗ ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/hyperdrive?modal=1&type=planetscale&step=1) ![Request flow from a user to Workers, Hyperdrive caches, connection pools, and PlanetScale.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1280,height=240,format=svg/_astro/planetscale-request-flow.CYsRfKtG.svg)

PlanetScale databases created from Cloudflare work with [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) through [Hyperdrive](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/). Hyperdrive manages database connection pools and query caching, so you can use PlanetScale as a centralized relational database for Workers applications without changing your database drivers, object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries, or SQL tooling.

PlanetScale usage appears on your Cloudflare invoice each billing period as a dollar total at PlanetScale's standard [pricing ↗︎](https://planetscale.com/pricing). You can introspect per-database billing usage via PlanetScale's [dashboard ↗︎](https://planetscale.com/docs/billing#organization-usage-and-billing-page).

When you create a PlanetScale database from the Cloudflare dashboard, you receive the same PlanetScale developer experience, including development branches, query insights, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server support for agents.
