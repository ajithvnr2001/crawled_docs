## Match Workers subrequests by upstream zone — cf.worker.upstream_zone now supported in Transform Rules

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

You can now use the [`cf.worker.upstream_zone`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.worker.upstream_zone/) field in [Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/) to control rule execution based on whether a request originates from [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), including subrequests issued by Workers in other zones.

**What's new:**

  * `cf.worker.upstream_zone` is now supported in Transform Rules expressions.
  * Skip or apply logic conditionally when handling [Workers subrequests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests).



For example, to add a header when the subrequest comes from another zone:

Text in **Expression Editor** (replace `myappexample.com` with your domain):
    
    
    (cf.worker.upstream_zone != "" and cf.worker.upstream_zone != "myappexample.com")

Selected operation under **Modify request header** : _Set static_

**Header name** : `X-External-Workers-Subrequest`

**Value** : `1`

This gives you more granular control in how you handle incoming requests for your zone.

Learn more in the [Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/) documentation and [Rules language fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/) reference.
