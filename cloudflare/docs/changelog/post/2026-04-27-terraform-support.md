## Pipelines and R2 Data Catalog now supported in Terraform

[Cloudflare Pipelines](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/) ingests streaming data via [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) or HTTP endpoints, transforms it with SQL, and writes it to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) as Apache Iceberg tables. [R2 Data Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/) manages those Iceberg tables, compaction, and compatibility with query engines like [R2 SQL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-sql/), [Spark](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/config-examples/spark-scala/), and [DuckDB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/config-examples/duckdb/).

You can now create and manage both products using Terraform, supported in the [Cloudflare Terraform provider v5.19.0 ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs).

This adds four new resources that let you define your entire data pipeline as infrastructure-as-code: a data catalog, a stream for ingestion, a sink that writes to R2 Data Catalog or R2, and a pipeline that connects them with SQL.

The new Terraform resources are:

  * [`cloudflare_r2_data_catalog` ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/r2_data_catalog) — enable the data catalog on an R2 bucket
  * [`cloudflare_pipeline_stream` ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_stream) — create a stream that receives events via HTTP or Worker bindings
  * [`cloudflare_pipeline_sink` ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/pipeline_sink) — create a sink that writes to R2 Data Catalog or R2
  * [`cloudflare_pipeline` ↗︎](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs/resources/pipeline) — create a pipeline with SQL connecting a stream to a sink



Here is a minimal example that creates a stream, an R2 Data Catalog sink, and a pipeline:
    
    
    resource "cloudflare_pipeline_stream" "my_stream" {
      account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
      name       = "my_stream"
      format     = { type = "json" }
      schema = {
        fields = [{
          name     = "value"
          type     = "json"
          required = true
        }]
      }
      http           = { enabled = true, authentication = false, cors = {} }
      worker_binding = { enabled = false }
    }
    
    resource "cloudflare_pipeline_sink" "my_sink" {
      account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
      name       = "my_sink"
      type       = "r2_data_catalog"
      format     = { type = "parquet" }
      schema     = { fields = [] }
      config = {
        account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
        bucket     = "my-pipeline-bucket"
        table_name = "my_table"
        token      = var.catalog_token
      }
    }
    
    resource "cloudflare_pipeline" "my_pipeline" {
      account_id = var.cloudflare_account_id
      name       = "my_pipeline"
      sql        = "INSERT INTO ${cloudflare_pipeline_sink.my_sink.name} SELECT * FROM ${cloudflare_pipeline_stream.my_stream.name}"
    }

For a full end-to-end example that includes R2 bucket creation, data catalog setup, and scoped API token provisioning, refer to the [Pipelines Terraform documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/reference/terraform/).
