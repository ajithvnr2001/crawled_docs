## The Cloudflare Vite plugin is now Generally Available

The [Cloudflare Vite plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/) has [reached v1.0 ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin) and is now Generally Available ("GA").

When you use `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, you can use Vite's local development server and build tooling, while ensuring that while developing, your code runs in [`workerd` ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers runtime.

This lets you get the best of both worlds for a full-stack app — you can use [Hot Module Replacement ↗︎](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) from Vite right alongside [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) and other runtime APIs and bindings that are unique to Cloudflare Workers.

`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` is made possible by the new [environment API ↗︎](https://vite.dev/guide/api-environment) in Vite, and was built [in partnership with the Vite team ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin).

#### Framework support

You can build any type of application with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`, using any rendering mode, from single page applications (SPA) and static sites to server-side rendered (SSR) pages and API routes.

[React Router v7 (Remix)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/react-router/) is the first full-stack framework to provide full support for Cloudflare Vite plugin, allowing you to use all parts of Cloudflare's developer platform, without additional build steps.

You can also build complete full-stack apps on Workers **without a framework** — ["just use Vite" ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-the-cloudflare-vite-plugin) and React together, and build a back-end API in the same Worker. Follow our [React SPA with an API tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/tutorial/) to learn how.

#### Configuration

If you're already using [Vite ↗︎](https://vite.dev/) in your build and development toolchain, you can start using our plugin with minimal changes to your `vite.config.ts`:

vite.config.tsts
    
    
    import { defineConfig } from "vite";
    import { cloudflare } from "@cloudflare/vite-plugin";
    
    export default defineConfig({
    	plugins: [cloudflare()],
    });
