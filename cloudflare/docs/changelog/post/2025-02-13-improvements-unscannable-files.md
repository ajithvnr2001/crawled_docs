Gateway HTTP policies can now block files that are password-protected, compressed, or otherwise unscannable.

These unscannable files are now matched with the [Download and Upload File Types traffic selectors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/#download-and-upload-file-types) for HTTP policies:

  * Password-protected Microsoft Office document
  * Password-protected PDF
  * Password-protected ZIP archive
  * Unscannable ZIP archive



To get started inspecting and modifying behavior based on these and other rules, refer to [HTTP filtering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/get-started/http/).
