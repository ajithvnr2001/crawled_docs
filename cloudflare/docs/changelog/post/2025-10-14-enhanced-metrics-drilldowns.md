AI Crawl Control now provides enhanced metrics and CSV data exports to help you better understand AI crawler activity across your sites.

#### What's new

#### Track crawler requests over time

Visualize crawler activity patterns over time, and group data by different dimensions:

  * **By Crawler** — Track activity from individual AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Bytespider)
  * **By Category** — Analyze crawler purpose or type
  * **By Operator** — Discover which companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance) are crawling your site
  * **By Host** — Break down activity across multiple subdomains
  * **By Status Code** — Monitor HTTP response codes to crawlers (200s, 300s, 400s, 500s)

#### Analyze referrer data (Paid plans)

Identify traffic sources with referrer analytics:

  * View top referrers driving traffic to your site
  * Understand discovery patterns and content popularity from AI operators
