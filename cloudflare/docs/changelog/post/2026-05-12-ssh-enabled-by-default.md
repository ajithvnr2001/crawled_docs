## SSH through Wrangler is now enabled by default for Containers

[Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/)

SSH through Wrangler is now enabled by default for [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/). Previously, you had to set `ssh.enabled` to `true` in your Container configuration before you could connect.

This change does not expose any publicly accessible ports on your Container. The SSH service is reachable only through [`wrangler containers ssh`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/containers/#containers-ssh), which authenticates against your Cloudflare account. You also need to add an `ssh-ed25519` public key to `authorized_keys` before anyone can connect, so enabling SSH alone does not grant access.

To connect, add a public key to your Container configuration and run `wrangler containers ssh <INSTANCE_ID>`:
    
    
    {
    	"containers": [
    		{
    			"authorized_keys": [
    				{
    					"name": "<NAME>",
    					"public_key": "<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE>",
    				},
    			],
    		},
    	],
    }
    
    
    [[containers]]
    [[containers.authorized_keys]]
    name = "<NAME>"
    public_key = "<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE>"

To disable SSH, set `ssh.enabled` to `false` in your Container configuration:
    
    
    {
    	"containers": [
    		{
    			"ssh": {
    				"enabled": false,
    			},
    		},
    	],
    }
    
    
    [[containers]]
    [containers.ssh]
    enabled = false
