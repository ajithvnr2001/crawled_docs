## See every release and gradual deployment on Workers Metrics charts

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Workers Metrics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/metrics-and-analytics/) charts now show every release in the selected time range, including the full progression of [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/). This makes it easier to correlate changes in memory, CPU time, errors, or latency with the code that was serving traffic.

A gradual deployment appears as a single rollout across the chart, with shading that increases as more traffic moves to the new version. Hover over a rollout to see the previous and new versions, the rollout duration, and the traffic percentage configured at each step.

Use these annotations to:

  * **Find when a regression started** — See which traffic percentage was configured when errors, latency, CPU time, or wall time changed.
  * **Compare rollout stages** — Check whether a metric changed as more traffic moved to the new version.
  * **Confirm rollbacks** — Rollbacks appear as separate release events, so you can check whether metrics recovered after a rollback.



Direct deployments that send 100% of traffic to a single version still appear as individual markers. Nearby direct deployments are grouped to reduce visual clutter. Versions that are only uploaded, or only configured at 0%, do not appear on metrics charts.

To view release annotations, open the **Metrics** tab for your [Worker ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/services/view/:worker/production/metrics).
