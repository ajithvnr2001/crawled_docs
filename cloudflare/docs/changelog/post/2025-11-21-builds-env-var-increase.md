## Environment variable limits increase for Workers Builds

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) now supports up to 64 environment variables, and each environment variable can be up to 5 KB in size. The previous limit was 5 KB total across all environment variables.

This change enables better support for complex build configurations, larger application settings, and more flexible CI/CD workflows.

For more details, refer to the [build limits documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/limits-and-pricing/#definitions).
