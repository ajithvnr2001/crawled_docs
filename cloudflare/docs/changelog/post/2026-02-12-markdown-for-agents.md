## Introducing Markdown for Agents

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)

Cloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using [content negotiation ↗︎](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation) headers. When AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for `text/markdown` in the request: our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.

Here is a curl example with the `Accept` negotiation header requesting this page from our developer documentation:
    
    
    curl https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/markdown-for-agents/ \
      -H "Accept: text/markdown"

The response to this request is now formatted in markdown:
    
    
    HTTP/2 200
    date: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:44:48 GMT
    content-type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8
    content-length: 2899
    vary: accept
    x-markdown-tokens: 725
    content-signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes

    ## What is Markdown for Agents
    
    Markdown has quickly become the lingua franca for agents and AI systems
    as a whole. The format’s explicit structure makes it ideal for AI processing,
    ultimately resulting in better results while minimizing token waste.
