This week highlights enhancements to detection signatures improving coverage for vulnerabilities in FortiWeb, linked to CVE-2025-64446, alongside new detection logic expanding protection against PHP Wrapper Injection techniques.

**Key Findings**

This vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to bypass access controls by abusing the `CGIINFO` header. The latest update strengthens detection logic to ensure a reliable identification of crafted requests attempting to exploit this flaw.

**Impact**

  * FortiWeb (CVE-2025-64446): Exploitation allows a remote unauthenticated adversary to circumvent authentication mechanisms by sending a manipulated `CGIINFO` header to FortiWeb’s backend CGI handler. Successful exploitation grants unintended access to restricted administrative functionality, potentially enabling configuration tampering or system-level actions.
