Each Workflow on Workers Paid now supports 10,000 steps by default, configurable up to 25,000 steps in your `wrangler.jsonc` file:
    
    
    {
    	"workflows": [
    		{
    			"name": "my-workflow",
    			"binding": "MY_WORKFLOW",
    			"class_name": "MyWorkflow",
    			"limits": {
    				"steps": 25000
    			}
    		}
    	]
    }

Previously, each instance was limited to 1,024 steps. Now, Workflows can support more complex, long-running executions without the additional complexity of recursive or child workflow calls.

Note that the maximum persisted state limit per Workflow instance remains **100 MB** for Workers Free and **1 GB** for Workers Paid. Refer to [Workflows limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/reference/limits/) for more information.
