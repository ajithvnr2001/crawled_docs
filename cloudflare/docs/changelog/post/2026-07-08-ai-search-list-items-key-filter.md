## Filter AI Search list items by exact object key

[AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/)

In [AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/), you can upload files to an instance, or connect a [data source](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/configuration/data-source/) such as an R2 bucket, to make your content searchable with natural language. Each file becomes an **item** identified by an object **key** (its filename or path). The [list items endpoint](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/items/rest-api/) returns the items in an instance.

That endpoint now accepts a `key` query parameter, so you can look up a single item by its exact object key without paging through the full list. This complements the existing `item_id` filter for when you know the key but not the ID.
    
    
    curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/ai-search/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>/items?key=docs/readme.md" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"

Keys are unique per data source, so combine `key` with `source` (for example, `source=builtin`) to disambiguate when the same key exists across multiple sources.

For more information, refer to [managing items](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/items/rest-api/).
