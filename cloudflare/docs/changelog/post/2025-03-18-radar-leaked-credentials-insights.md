## Leaked Credentials Insights in Cloudflare Radar

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) has expanded its security insights, providing visibility into aggregate trends in authentication requests, including the detection of leaked credentials through [leaked credentials detection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/) scans.

We have now introduced the following endpoints:

  * [`/leaked_credential_checks/summary/{dimension}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/leaked_credentials/subresources/summary/): Retrieves summaries of HTTP authentication requests distribution across two different dimensions.
  * [`/leaked_credential_checks/timeseries_groups/{dimension}`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/leaked_credentials/subresources/timeseries_groups/): Retrieves timeseries data for HTTP authentication requests distribution across two different dimensions.



The following dimensions are available, displaying the distribution of HTTP authentication requests based on:

  * `compromised`: Credential status (clean vs. compromised).
  * `bot_class`: [Bot class](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/concepts/bot-classes) (human vs. bot).
