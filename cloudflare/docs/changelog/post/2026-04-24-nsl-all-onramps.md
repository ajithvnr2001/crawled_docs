## Network Session Logs now available for all on-ramps

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)

[Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/) are now generated for all traffic proxied through Cloudflare Gateway, regardless of on-ramp type. This includes traffic from [proxy endpoints (PAC files)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/proxy-endpoints/) and [Browser Isolation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/) egress — on-ramps that previously did not generate session logs.

Customers who already consume the `zero_trust_network_sessions` dataset via [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/) or [Log Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/observability/logs/log-explorer/) may see increased log volume if they use these on-ramps.

For traffic analysis, refer to [Network session analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/network-sessions/).
