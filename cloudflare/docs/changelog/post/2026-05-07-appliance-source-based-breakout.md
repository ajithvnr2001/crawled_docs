## Source-based breakout and prioritization on Cloudflare One Appliance

Breakout and traffic prioritization rules on the Cloudflare One Appliance can now match by **source** in addition to destination application. You can pin breakout or priority behavior to:

  * A source LAN interface — VLANs attached to that LAN are included automatically.
  * A source IP address, range, or CIDR block.



This is the natural way to break out a guest VLAN to the local Internet, or to prioritize traffic from a specific subnet, without enumerating destination applications.

For details, refer to [Breakout traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/appliance/network-options/application-based-policies/breakout-traffic/#breakout-by-source).
