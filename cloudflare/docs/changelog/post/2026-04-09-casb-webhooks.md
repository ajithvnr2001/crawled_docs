You can now use **CASB webhooks** in Cloudflare One to send posture finding instances to external systems such as chat platforms, ticketing systems, SIEMs, SOAR tools, and custom automation services.

This gives security teams a simple way to route CASB posture findings into the tools and workflows they already use for triage and response.

To get started, go to **Integrations** > **Webhooks** in the Cloudflare One dashboard to create a webhook destination. After you configure a webhook, open a posture finding instance and select **Send webhook** to send it.

#### Key capabilities

  * **Flexible authentication** — Configure destinations using **None** , **Basic Auth** , **Bearer Auth** , **Static Headers** , or **HMAC-Signing**.
  * **Built-in testing** — Use **Test delivery** to send a test request before sending a live finding instance.
  * **Posture finding workflows** — Send posture finding instances directly from the finding details workflow in **Cloud & SaaS findings**.
  * **HTTPS destinations** — Configure webhook destinations with public `https://` URLs.
