[Custom Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/) are now generally available for all paid plans — bringing a unified and powerful experience for customizing error responses at both the zone and account levels.

You can now manage **Custom Error Rules** , **Custom Error Assets** , and redesigned **Error Pages** directly from the Cloudflare dashboard. These features let you deliver tailored messaging when errors occur, helping you maintain brand consistency and improve user experience — whether it’s a 404 from your origin or a security challenge from Cloudflare.

What's new:

  * **Custom Errors are now GA** – Available on all paid plans and ready for production traffic.
  * **UI for Custom Error Rules and Assets** – Manage your zone-level rules from the Rules > Overview and your zone-level assets from the Rules > Settings tabs.
  * **Define inline content or upload assets** – Create custom responses directly in the rule builder, upload new or reuse previously stored assets.
  * **Refreshed UI and new name for Error Pages** – Formerly known as “Custom Pages,” Error Pages now offer a cleaner, more intuitive experience for both zone and account-level configurations.
  * **Powered by Ruleset Engine** – Custom Error Rules support [conditional logic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/) and override Error Pages for 500 and 1000 class errors, as well as errors originating from your origin or [other Cloudflare products](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/). You can also configure [Response Header Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/response-header-modification/) to add, change, or remove HTTP headers from responses returned by Custom Error Rules.
