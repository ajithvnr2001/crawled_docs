## Advanced WAF customization for AI Crawl Control blocks

[AI Crawl Control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/)

AI Crawl Control now supports extending the underlying WAF rule with custom modifications. Any changes you make directly in the WAF custom rules editor — such as adding path-based exceptions, extra user agents, or additional expression clauses — are preserved when you update crawler actions in AI Crawl Control.

If the WAF rule expression has been modified in a way AI Crawl Control cannot parse, a warning banner appears on the **Crawlers** page with a link to view the rule directly in WAF.

For more information, refer to [WAF rule management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/manage-ai-crawlers/#waf-rule-management).
