This update provides immediate defense against critical vulnerabilities affecting WordPress and JFrog Artifactory, including path traversal, local file inclusion (LFI), cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication bypass exploits.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-87902: A high-severity Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting WordPress. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to read arbitrary files on the host server, potentially exposing sensitive configuration data or system files.

  * CVE-2026-42018 & CVE-2026-82329: Critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities affecting JFrog Artifactory. Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security controls and achieve unauthorized access to the Artifactory instance.




**Impact**

We strongly recommend that administrators apply the latest vendor patches for WordPress and JFrog Artifactory to fully secure origin servers.
