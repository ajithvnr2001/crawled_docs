[Cloudflare CASB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/) is an API-based (agentless) tool that continuously scans your SaaS and cloud applications for security misconfigurations and data exposure. You can now use **CASB remediation policies** to automatically fix a finding or send a webhook the moment CASB detects it, without manual triage.

#### Remediate Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace findings

A policy can perform a first-party remediation action directly against the SaaS integration API. When a policy triggers, Cloudflare revokes the external sharing configuration without human intervention.

Remediation is currently supported for file-sharing findings in Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. Support for additional finding types and integrations is coming soon. For the full list of supported finding types, refer to [Run remediations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/policies/#run-remediations) in the CASB remediation policies documentation.

#### Send webhooks

A policy can send posture finding data to Slack, ServiceNow, or any other webhook destination. Webhook actions are supported for all posture finding types across CASB integrations.

A single policy can perform both actions: remediate a finding and send a webhook.

#### Get started

  1. In [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Cloud & SaaS findings** > **Policies**.
  2. Select **Create a policy**.
  3. Under **Basic information** , enter a **Policy name** and, optionally, a **Description**.
  4. Under **Choose how you want to trigger the policy** , select a **Vendor** , **Integration** , and **Finding type**.
  5. Under **Define what to do with findings that match your trigger** , choose **Run Remediation** , **Send webhooks** , or both.
  6. Under **Status** , turn on **Enable policy**.
  7. Select **Create policy**.
