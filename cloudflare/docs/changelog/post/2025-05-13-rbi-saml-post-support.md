## SAML HTTP-POST bindings support for RBI

[Browser Isolation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/)

Remote Browser Isolation (RBI) now supports SAML HTTP-POST bindings, enabling seamless authentication for SSO-enabled applications that rely on POST-based SAML responses from Identity Providers (IdPs) within a Remote Browser Isolation session. This update resolves a previous limitation that caused `405` errors during login and improves compatibility with multi-factor authentication (MFA) flows.

With expanded support for major IdPs like Okta and Azure AD, this enhancement delivers a more consistent and user-friendly experience across authentication workflows. Learn how to [set up Remote Browser Isolation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/).
