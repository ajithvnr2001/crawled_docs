A new Beta release for the macOS WARP client is now available on the [beta releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/).

This release contains minor fixes and introduces a brand new visual style for the client interface. The new Cloudflare One Client interface changes connectivity management from a toggle to a button and brings useful connectivity settings to the home screen. The redesign also introduces a collapsible navigation bar. When expanded, more client information can be accessed including connectivity, settings, and device profile information. If you have any feedback or questions, visit the [Cloudflare Community forum](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/introducing-the-new-cloudflare-one-client-interface/901362) and let us know.

**Changes and improvements**

  * Empty MDM files are now rejected instead of being incorrectly accepted as a single MDM config.
  * Fixed an issue in proxy mode where the client could become unresponsive due to upstream connection timeouts.
  * Fixed emergency disconnect state from a previous organization incorrectly persisting after switching organizations.
  * Consumer-only CLI commands are now clearly distinguished from Zero Trust commands.
  * Added detailed QUIC connection metrics to diagnostic logs for better troubleshooting.
  * Added monitoring for tunnel statistics collection timeouts.
  * Switched tunnel congestion control algorithm to Cubic for improved reliability across platforms.
  * Fixed initiating managed network detection checks when no network is available, which caused device profile flapping.



**Known issues**

  * The client may become stuck in a `Connecting` state. To resolve this issue, reconnect the client by selecting **Disconnect** and then **Connect** in the client user interface. Alternatively, change the client's operation mode.
  * The client may display an empty white screen upon the device waking from sleep. To resolve this issue, exit and then open the client to re-launch it.
  * Canceling login during a single MDM configuration setup results in an empty page with no way to resume authentication. To work around this issue, exit and relaunch the client.
