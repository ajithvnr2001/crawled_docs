## Require Access protection for zones

You can now require Cloudflare Access protection for all hostnames in your account. When enabled, traffic to any hostname that does not have a matching Access application is automatically blocked.

This deny-by-default approach prevents accidental exposure of internal resources to the public Internet. If a developer deploys a new application or creates a DNS record without configuring an Access application, the traffic is blocked rather than exposed.

#### How it works

  * **Blocked by default** : Traffic to all hostnames in the account is blocked unless an Access application exists for that hostname.
  * **Explicit access required** : To allow traffic, create an Access application with an Allow or Bypass policy.
  * **Hostname exemptions** : You can exempt specific hostnames from this requirement.
