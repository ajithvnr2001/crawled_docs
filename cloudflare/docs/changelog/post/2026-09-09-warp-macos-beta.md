A new Beta release for the macOS Cloudflare One Client is now available on the [beta releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/).

This beta release includes the following changes and improvements:

  * Added support for routing non-RFC 1918 local IPv4 networks through the WARP tunnel when unrestricted LAN inclusion is enabled by policy or MDM.
  * Improved DNS reliability on networks with lower MTUs by clamping the TCP maximum segment size (MSS) for DNS-over-HTTPS connections sent through the tunnel.
  * Improved API reliability by retrying requests dropped when reusing pooled connections.
  * Fixed Extra Logging failing to capture packets across all interfaces.
  * Fixed an issue that could prevent remote diagnostics from completing.
  * Fixed DNS connectivity checks failing on IPv6-only networks.
  * Fixed the client service exiting when its route-monitoring socket was closed after sleep or wake.
  * Fixed DNS enforcement checks making the client service unresponsive on systems with large routing tables.
  * Fixed slow captive portal checks causing the client service to become unresponsive or restart while connecting.
  * Fixed a race when switching tunnel protocols during key rotation that could prevent WireGuard from connecting.
  * Fixed the client continuing to report 'No network' after a successful manual disconnect.
  * Fixed a client UI crash that could occur when the daemon connection was reset during an IPC request.
  * Fixed a startup crash when date formatting data for the system locale had not yet loaded.
