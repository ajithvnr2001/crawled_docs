`deleteAll()` now deletes a Durable Object alarm in addition to stored data for Workers with a compatibility date of `2026-02-24` or later. This change simplifies clearing a Durable Object's storage with a single API call.

Previously, `deleteAll()` only deleted user-stored data for an object. Alarm usage stores metadata in an object's storage, which required a separate `deleteAlarm()` call to fully clean up all storage for an object. The `deleteAll()` change applies to both KV-backed and SQLite-backed Durable Objects.
    
    
    // Before: two API calls required to clear all storage
    await this.ctx.storage.deleteAlarm();
    await this.ctx.storage.deleteAll();
    
    // Now: a single call clears both data and the alarm
    await this.ctx.storage.deleteAll();

For more information, refer to the [Storage API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/#deleteall).
