## APO caches more crawler and bot traffic again

[Automatic Platform Optimization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/)

We fixed a regression where Automatic Platform Optimization (APO) stopped caching some HTML requests that did not send an explicit `Accept: text/html` header — commonly crawlers, bots, and uptime monitors. These requests were being served from your origin (`cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`) instead of the cache.

APO now caches these requests again. No action is needed. If you added a Transform Rule to set `Accept: text/html` as a workaround, you can remove it.

For details on how APO decides what to cache, refer to [About APO](https://developers.cloudflare.com/automatic-platform-optimization/about/).
