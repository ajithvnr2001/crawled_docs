This release introduces new rules and updates Microsoft SharePoint RCE alongside enhanced SSRF cloud protection rule actions.

  * CVE-2026-66066: An improper input processing vulnerability in Ruby on Rails Active Storage image variant transformations. This may allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform arbitrary file reads and achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) using maliciously crafted payload requests.
  * Generic Cloud Protections: Added improved detection logic targeting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in cloud-hosted applications.
