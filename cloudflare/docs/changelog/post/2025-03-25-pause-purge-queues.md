## New Pause & Purge APIs for Queues

[Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/)

[Queues](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/) now supports the ability to pause message delivery and/or purge (delete) messages on a queue. These operations can be useful when:

  * Your consumer has a bug or downtime, and you want to temporarily stop messages from being processed while you fix the bug
  * You have pushed invalid messages to a queue due to a code change during development, and you want to clean up the backlog
  * Your queue has a backlog that is stale and you want to clean it up to allow new messages to be consumed



To pause a queue using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), run the `pause-delivery` command. Paused queues continue to receive messages. And you can easily unpause a queue using the `resume-delivery` command.

Pause and resume a queuebash
    
    
    $ wrangler queues pause-delivery my-queue
    Pausing message delivery for queue my-queue.
    Paused message delivery for queue my-queue.
    
    $ wrangler queues resume-delivery my-queue
    Resuming message delivery for queue my-queue.
    Resumed message delivery for queue my-queue.

Purging a queue permanently deletes all messages in the queue. Unlike pausing, purging is an irreversible operation:

Purge a queuebash
    
    
    $ wrangler queues purge my-queue
    ✔ This operation will permanently delete all the messages in queue my-queue. Type my-queue to proceed. … my-queue
    Purged queue 'my-queue'

You can also do these operations using the [Queues REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/queues/), or the dashboard page for a queue.

This feature is available on all new and existing queues. Head over to the [pause and purge documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pause-purge) to learn more. And if you haven't used Cloudflare Queues before, [get started with the Cloudflare Queues guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/get-started).
