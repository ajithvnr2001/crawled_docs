A new GA release for the macOS Cloudflare One Client is now available on the [stable releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/).

This release contains minor fixes and improvements.

The next stable release for macOS will introduce the new Cloudflare One Client UI, providing a cleaner and more intuitive design as well as easier access to common actions and information.

**Changes and improvements**

  * Empty MDM files are now rejected instead of being incorrectly accepted as a single MDM config.
  * Fixed an issue in local proxy mode where the client could become unresponsive due to upstream connection timeouts.
  * Fixed an issue where the emergency disconnect status of a prior organization persisted after a switch to a different organization.
  * Consumer-only CLI commands are now clearly distinguished from Zero Trust commands.
  * Added detailed QUIC connection metrics to diagnostic logs for better troubleshooting.
  * Added monitoring for tunnel statistics collection timeouts.
  * Switched tunnel congestion control algorithm for local proxy mode to Cubic for improved reliability across platforms.
  * Fixed initiating managed network detections checks when no network is available, which caused device profile flapping.
