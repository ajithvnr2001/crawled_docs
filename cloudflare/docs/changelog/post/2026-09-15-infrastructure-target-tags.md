## Access for Infrastructure now supports tagged targets and tag-based target criteria

[Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/) now integrates with [Resource Tagging](https://developers.cloudflare.com/resource-tagging/). You can attach key-value tags to [infrastructure targets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/#1-add-a-target) and use them in access policies.

You can manage tags on targets inline when you create or edit a target or through the central [Resource Tagging API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/resource-tagging/how-to/manage-tags/). Cloudflare keeps tags in sync across both methods.

Infrastructure applications also support a target criteria model with `include`, `require`, and `exclude` operators. Each operator can match targets by hostname, tag, or both.

  * **Include** matches targets that have any of the specified values.
  * **Require** matches targets that have all of the specified values.
  * **Exclude** rejects targets that have any of the specified values.
