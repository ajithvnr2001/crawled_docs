## Finer-grained chart granularity on Cloudflare Radar for longer time ranges

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now provides finer-grained traffic charts for longer time ranges. Previously, selecting a 1-3 month view on HTTP and NetFlows charts defaulted to weekly aggregation, which was too coarse to surface meaningful trends. Views longer than 3 months defaulted to monthly aggregation, returning as few as 7 data points for a 6-month range.

The new defaults are:

  * **1-3 months** : daily granularity (7x more data points)
  * **Longer than 3 months** (HTTP and NetFlows): weekly granularity (4x more data points)



For example, a 12-week traffic view previously showed weekly data:

The same view now shows daily data:

Similarly, a 1-year HTTP traffic view that previously showed just 12 monthly data points now provides 52 weekly data points.
