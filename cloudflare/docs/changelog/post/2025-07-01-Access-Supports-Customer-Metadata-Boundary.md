## Cloudflare Access Logging supports the Customer Metadata Boundary (CMB)

[Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/)

Cloudflare Access logs now support the [Customer Metadata Boundary (CMB)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/data-localization/metadata-boundary/). If you have configured the CMB for your account, all Access logging will respect that configuration.

Note

For EU CMB customers, the logs will not be stored by Access and will appear as empty in the dashboard. EU CMB customers should utilize [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/) to retain their Access logging, if desired.
