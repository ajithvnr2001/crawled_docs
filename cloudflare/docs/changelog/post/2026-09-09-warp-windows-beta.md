A new Beta release for the Windows Cloudflare One Client is now available on the [beta releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/).

This beta release includes the following changes and improvements:

  * Added support for routing non-RFC 1918 local IPv4 networks through the WARP tunnel when unrestricted LAN inclusion is enabled by policy or MDM.
  * Improved DNS reliability on networks with lower MTUs by clamping the TCP maximum segment size (MSS) for DNS-over-HTTPS connections sent through the tunnel.
  * Improved API reliability by retrying requests dropped when reusing pooled connections.
  * The client no longer requires the Windows WLAN AutoConfig service to be running.
  * Implemented a service recovery mechanism backed by Windows scheduler task to start WARP service on system unlock if not already started.
  * Fixed slow captive portal checks causing the client service to become unresponsive or restart while connecting.
  * Fixed a race when switching tunnel protocols during key rotation that could prevent WireGuard from connecting.
  * Fixed the client continuing to report 'No network' after a successful manual disconnect.
  * Fixed Digital Experience Monitoring (DEX) HTTP tests failing TLS validation on Windows.
  * Fixed the client UI crashing at startup when it could not write to the Windows registry.
  * Fixed latency spikes and traffic interruptions during TPM-backed API authentication when hardware-backed registration is enabled.
  * Fixed trailing whitespace in BIOS serial numbers causing serial-number and client-certificate device posture checks to fail.
  * Fixed a client UI crash that could occur when the daemon connection was reset during an IPC request.
  * Fixed a startup crash when date formatting data for the system locale had not yet loaded.
