## Increased Workflows limits and improved instance queueing.

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) (beta) now allows you to define up to 1024 [steps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowstep). `sleep` steps do not count against this limit.

We've also added:

  * `instanceId` as property to the [`WorkflowEvent`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowevent) type, allowing you to retrieve the current instance ID from within a running Workflow instance
  * Improved queueing logic for Workflow instances beyond the current maximum concurrent instances, reducing the cases where instances are stuck in the queued state.
  * Support for [`pause` and `resume`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#pause) for Workflow instances in a queued state.



We're continuing to work on increases to the number of concurrent Workflow instances, steps, and support for a new `waitForEvent` API over the coming weeks.
