## Region Filtering, AS Traffic Volume, and Navigation Improvements on Cloudflare Radar

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) ships several new features that improve the flexibility and usability of the platform, as well as visibility into what is happening on the Internet.

#### Region filtering

All location-aware pages now support filtering by region, including continents, geographic subregions ([Middle East ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/middle-east), [Eastern Asia ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/eastern-asia), etc.), political regions ([EU ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/european-union), [African Union ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/african-union)), and US Census regions/divisions (for example, [New England ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/us-new-england), [US Northeast ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/us-northeast)).

#### Traffic volume by top autonomous systems and locations

A new traffic volume view shows the top autonomous systems and countries/territories for a given location. This is useful for quickly determining which network providers in a location may be experiencing connectivity issues, or how traffic is distributed across a region.

The new AS and location dimensions have also been added to the [Data Explorer ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer) for the HTTP, DNS, and NetFlows datasets. Combined with other available filters, this provides a powerful tool for generating unique insights.

Finally, breadcrumb navigation is now available on most pages, allowing easier navigation between parent and related pages.
