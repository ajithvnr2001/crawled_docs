SSH with [Cloudflare Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-infrastructure-access/) allows you to use short-lived SSH certificates to eliminate SSH key management and reduce security risks associated with lost or stolen keys.

Previously, users had to generate this certificate by using the [Cloudflare API ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) directly. With this update, you can now create and manage this certificate in the [Cloudflare One dashboard ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) from the **Access controls** > **Service credentials** page.

![Navigate to Access controls and then Service credentials to see where you can generate an SSH CA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2710,height=1180,format=webp/_astro/SSH-CA-generation.DYa9RnX1.png)
