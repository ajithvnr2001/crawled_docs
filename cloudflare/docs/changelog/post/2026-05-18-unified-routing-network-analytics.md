## Network Analytics support for Unified Routing

[Cloudflare WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/)[Magic Transit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/)

[Network Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/network-analytics/) is now fully supported for accounts using [Unified Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/reference/traffic-steering/#unified-routing) mode. Traffic that traverses Unified Routing onramps and offramps is now visible in Network Analytics with the same dimensions and filters as traffic on the standard data plane.

This closes a parity gap for customers who had moved tunnels onto Unified Routing and lost visibility into their dataplane traffic in the Network Analytics dashboard. No configuration change is required — analytics data is collected automatically for all accounts with Unified Routing enabled.

For the remaining beta limitations, refer to [Traffic steering beta limitations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/reference/traffic-steering/#check-feature-availability-before-upgrading).
