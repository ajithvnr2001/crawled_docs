## Applications to be remapped to the new categories

We have previously added new application categories to better reflect their content and improve HTTP traffic management: refer to [Changelog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/changelog/gateway/#2025-10-28). While the new categories are live now, we want to ensure you have ample time to review and adjust any existing rules you have configured against old categories. The remapping of existing applications into these new categories will be completed by January 30, 2026. This timeline allows you a dedicated period to:

  * Review the new category structure.
  * Identify any policies you have that target the older categories.
  * Adjust your rules to reference the new, more precise categories before the old mappings change. Once the applications have been fully remapped by January 30, 2026, you might observe some changes in the traffic being mitigated or allowed by your existing policies. We encourage you to use the intervening time to prepare for a smooth transition.
