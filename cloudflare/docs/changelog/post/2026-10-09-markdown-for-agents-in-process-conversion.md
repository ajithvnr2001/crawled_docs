## More efficient Markdown for Agents conversion

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)

[Markdown for Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/markdown-for-agents/) now converts HTML with an in-process streaming engine at the edge. It processes content as it arrives instead of buffering the HTML response and sending it to a separate conversion service. This reduces conversion overhead and memory use.

This release also changes the conversion limit and response headers:

  * Conversion supports up to 6 MiB (6,291,456 bytes) of decompressed HTML, increased from 2 MiB (2,097,152 bytes). The limit applies after decompression, not to the compressed response size.
  * Converted responses no longer generate the `x-markdown-tokens` or `x-original-tokens` headers. Clients that use these values need to calculate token counts themselves.
  * `Content-Length` is removed from converted responses rather than recalculated, because the Markdown body is streamed.
