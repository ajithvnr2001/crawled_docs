## Block emails by content with blocked content rules

Cloudflare Email security now lets administrators write their own content-based blocking rules. A new **Blocked content** area under **Policies & rules** lets you define a plaintext string or a regular expression, choose whether to scan the message subject, body, or both, and automatically block any message that matches.

  * Create rules using either **plaintext** matches or **regular expressions** — useful for blocking targeted phishing campaigns, known-bad phrases, or content patterns unique to your organization.
  * Choose the **search location** for each rule: **subject** , **body** , or **subject and body**.
  * Use the built-in **regular expression checker** to validate your pattern against sample text before saving, so you can confirm the rule matches what you expect and avoid false positives.
  * Matching messages are marked with a malicious [disposition](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/) and prevented from reaching users' inboxes.



Blocked content rules currently only support the block action.

This feature is available for the following Email security packages:

  * **Enterprise**
  * **Enterprise + PhishGuard**



To get started, refer to [Blocked content](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/policies/inbound/blocked-content/).
