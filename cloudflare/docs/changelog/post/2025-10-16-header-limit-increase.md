#### CDN now supports 128 KB request and response headers 🚀

We're excited to announce a significant increase in the maximum header size supported by Cloudflare's Content Delivery Network (CDN). Cloudflare now supports up to **128 KB** for both **request and response headers**.

Previously, customers were limited to a total of 32 KB for request or response headers, with a maximum of 16 KB per individual header. Larger headers could cause requests to fail with `HTTP 413` (Request Header Fields Too Large) errors.

#### What's new?

  * **Support for large headers:** You can now utilize much larger headers, whether as a single large header up to 128 KB or split over multiple headers.
  * **Reduces`413` and `520` HTTP errors:** This change drastically reduces the likelihood of customers encountering `HTTP 413` errors from large request headers or `HTTP 520` errors caused by oversized response headers, improving the overall reliability of your web applications.
  * **Enhanced functionality:** This is especially beneficial for applications that rely on: 
    * A large number of cookies.
    * Large Content-Security-Policy (CSP) response headers.
    * Advanced use cases with Cloudflare Workers that generate large response headers.



This enhancement improves compatibility with Cloudflare's CDN, enabling more use cases that previously failed due to header size limits.
