## /cdn-cgi/rum endpoint now returns 405 for non-POST requests

[Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/)

The `/cdn-cgi/rum` beacon endpoint now returns `405 Method Not Allowed` for non-POST requests instead of `404 Not Found`. The response includes an `Allow: POST, OPTIONS` header per [RFC 9110 §15.5.6 ↗︎](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.6).

Previously, sending a `GET` or other non-POST request to this endpoint returned a `404`, which was misleading because it suggested the endpoint did not exist. The new `405` response clearly indicates that the endpoint exists but only accepts `POST` requests.

The Web Analytics beacon (`beacon.min.js`) already uses `POST` for all metric submissions, so this change does not affect normal beacon operation. `OPTIONS` requests for CORS preflight continue to work as before.
