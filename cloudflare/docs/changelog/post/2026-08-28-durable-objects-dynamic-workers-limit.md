## Durable Objects can use up to ten Dynamic Workers concurrently

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)

[Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) can have up to ten distinct [Dynamic Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/) with in-flight requests, increased from four. This limit applies across all concurrent requests to the same Durable Object because they share an input/output (I/O) context. Other Workers can have up to four distinct Dynamic Workers with in-flight requests per request.

Multiple in-flight requests to the same Dynamic Worker count as one toward this limit.
