## Reduced minimum cache TTL for Workers KV to 30 seconds

[KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/)

The minimum `cacheTtl` parameter for Workers KV has been reduced from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. This change applies to both `get()` and `getWithMetadata()` methods.

This reduction allows you to maintain more up-to-date cached data and have finer-grained control over cache behavior. Applications requiring faster data refresh rates can now configure cache durations as low as 30 seconds instead of the previous 60-second minimum.

The `cacheTtl` parameter defines how long a KV result is cached at the global network location it is accessed from:
    
    
    // Read with custom cache TTL
    const value = await env.NAMESPACE.get("my-key", {
    	cacheTtl: 30, // Cache for minimum 30 seconds (previously 60)
    });
    
    // getWithMetadata also supports the reduced cache TTL
    const valueWithMetadata = await env.NAMESPACE.getWithMetadata("my-key", {
    	cacheTtl: 30, // Cache for minimum 30 seconds
    });

The default cache TTL remains unchanged at 60 seconds. Upgrade to the latest version of Wrangler to be able to use 30 seconds `cacheTtl`.

This change affects all KV read operations using the binding API. For more information, consult the [Workers KV cache TTL documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/api/read-key-value-pairs/#cachettl-parameter).
