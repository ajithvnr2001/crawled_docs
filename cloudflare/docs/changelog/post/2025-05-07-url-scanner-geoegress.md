## URL Scanner now supports geo-specific scanning

Enterprise customers can now choose the geographic location from which a URL scan is performed — either via [Security Center](https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/investigate/) in the Cloudflare dashboard or via the [URL Scanner API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/url_scanner/subresources/scans/methods/create/).

This feature gives security teams greater insight into how a website behaves across different regions, helping uncover targeted, location-specific threats.

**What’s new:**

  * Location Picker: Select a location for the scan via **Security Center → Investigate** in the dashboard or through the API.
  * Region-aware scanning: Understand how content changes by location — useful for detecting regionally tailored attacks.
  * Default behavior: If no location is set, scans default to the user’s current geographic region.
