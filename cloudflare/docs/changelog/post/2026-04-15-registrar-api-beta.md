Cloudflare Registrar API is now in beta.

You can now use the Cloudflare API to:

  * Search for domain names.
  * Check real-time availability and pricing.
  * Register supported domains programmatically.



This beta supports a subset of popular extensions available through Cloudflare Registrar. Search returns suggestions across API-supported extensions, check confirms current availability and pricing, and registration starts a workflow that can complete immediately or be polled if it takes longer.

Because the Registrar API is part of the Cloudflare API, it can also be used in [Cloudflare MCP ↗︎](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp) and other agent-driven workflows.

If you are using Cloudflare MCP or other agent-driven workflows, prompts can be as simple as:

  * `Search for domain ideas for a coffee shop based in Evergreen, Colorado.`
  * `Check whether example.com is available and show me the current price.`
  * `Register example.com`



For supported operations, extension availability, and workflow details, refer to:

  * [Registrar API guide ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/registrar-api/)
  * [Registrar API reference ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/registrar)
