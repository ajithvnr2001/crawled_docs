## Web Analytics adds Navigation Type filtering and reporting

Cloudflare Web Analytics now supports **Navigation Type** reporting and filtering.

This update allows developers and performance analysts to see how users are navigating between pages — whether through a link click or form submission, a page reload, or using the browser's back/forward buttons — and whether a browser cache hit occurred for these behaviors.

Understanding navigation types is critical for optimizing user experience. For example, if a high volume of your traffic consists of "Back-forward" navigations versus "Back-forward Cache", those visitors are not benefiting from the Back/Forward Cache (bfcache) and therefore are experiencing higher load times due to potentially unnecessary network requests.

The same applies for regular "Navigate" entries — where "Navigate Cache", "Navigate Prefetch Cache" and "Prerender" would provide instant document retrieval — and "Reload", where "Reload cache" would be more optimal.

A high volume of "Reload" entries can also indicate a potential stability problem with your website.

By identifying these patterns, you can tune your browser caching strategies to ensure HTML documents are served instantaneously from local caches rather than requiring a roundtrip to the network.

For more information, refer to [Navigation Types](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/data-metrics/dimensions/#navigation-types).

#### Key benefits

  * **Monitor Cache Effectiveness:** See how often your site is served from the HTTP cache or bfcache.
  * **Identify Performance Bottlenecks:** Filter by the different types to understand performance opportunity of improving browser cache hit ratio.



#### Analyze navigation types in the Cloudflare dashboard

You can now find the **Navigation Type** dimension in the Web Analytics dashboard. You can filter to include/exclude one or more specific types using "equals", "does not equal", "in", or "not in" matchers.

To check the list of popular navigation types, select **Page views** on the Web Analytics sidebar and scroll down to the bottom:
