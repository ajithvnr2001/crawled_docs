## Manage all your routes from one page in the dashboard

[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/)[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/)[Cloudflare WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/)[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)

The **Routes** page in the Cloudflare dashboard now shows the routes across all of your connectors — [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/) and [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/) routes alongside [Cloudflare WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/) and [Magic Transit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/) static routes — in a single table, instead of a separate routes view per product.

From the unified Routes page you can:

  * **Visualize your network with an interactive map** that shows how your destinations flow through to your connectors — including equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) routes where the same prefix is served by several connectors. Select a node to filter the table down to the routes behind it.
  * **See every route in one table** , with its destination, type, connector, priority, and source, and filter or sort to find what you need.
  * **Create, edit, and delete routes** of any supported type without leaving the page. When adding a Cloudflare WAN or Magic Transit static route, you now pick the next hop by **connector name** instead of typing its IP.
  * **Manage[virtual networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/virtual-networks/)** from a dedicated tab.
  * **Test a route** to see which connector and next hop a destination resolves to before you commit a change.



To find it, go to **Networking** > **Routes** in the dashboard sidebar.

Your existing routes, APIs, and configurations are unchanged — this is a dashboard experience that brings them together in one place.
