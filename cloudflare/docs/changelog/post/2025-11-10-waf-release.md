This week’s release introduces new detections for Prototype Pollution across three common vectors: URI, Body, and Header/Form.

**Key Findings**

  * These attacks can affect both API and web applications by altering normal behavior or bypassing security controls.



**Impact**

Exploitation may allow attackers to change internal logic or cause unexpected behavior in applications using JavaScript or Node.js frameworks. Developers should sanitize input keys and avoid merging untrusted data structures.
