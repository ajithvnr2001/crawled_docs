## Identify Mesh, Workers VPC, and Cloudflare Tunnel replicas in network logs

[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/)[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/)[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)[Workers VPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/)

You can now tell a person on a laptop apart from a Mesh node or an AI agent running on Workers, without matching on connector email addresses or Mesh IP ranges — and see exactly which Cloudflare Tunnel and `cloudflared` replica received each session.

[Gateway network logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/gateway-logs/#network-logs) and [Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/) now identify two new kinds of traffic:

  * **Mesh** — Traffic sent from or delivered to a [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/) node. Previously, Mesh nodes were logged the same way as devices running the [Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/), because Mesh nodes run the client in headless mode.
  * **Workers VPC** — Traffic sent by a Worker through a [Workers VPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/) binding. Previously, Workers VPC sessions were not recorded in Network Session Logs.

#### Gateway network logs

To view these values in the dashboard, go to **Zero Trust** > **Insights & Logs** > **Logs** > **Network logs** , select **Columns** , and turn on **Traffic Source** and **Traffic Destination**. Both values also appear under **Network query details** when you open a log entry.

#### Network Session Logs

The `zero_trust_network_sessions` dataset, available through [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/), includes the following fields:

Field | Description  
---|---  
`OnrampType` | How the session entered Cloudflare One. Values: `CF1_CLIENT`, `MESH`, `WORKERS_VPC`, `MAGIC`, `OTHER`.  
`Offramp` | Where the session was routed. Sessions routed to a Mesh node report `MESH`.  
`SourceName` | Name of the Worker that started the session. Only populated for Workers VPC sessions.  
`SourceID` | Stable identifier of the Worker that started the session. Only populated for Workers VPC sessions.  
`DestinationReplicaID` | The replica that served the session, such as a specific replica of a Mesh node or a `cloudflared` replica of a Cloudflare Tunnel.  
  
For example, `OnrampType = 'WORKERS_VPC' AND Offramp = 'MESH'` returns every session where a Worker reached a service behind a Mesh node, and `SourceName` tells you which Worker it was.

Redeploy your Workers

`SourceName` and `SourceID` are only populated for Workers deployed after 29 September 2026. To include them for an existing Worker, redeploy it — for example, with `npx wrangler deploy`. No code changes are required.

#### See which tunnel and replica received a session

With `DestinationReplicaID`, you can now confirm which [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/) and which `cloudflared` replica received traffic for a specific session. Combine it with the existing `DestinationTunnelID` field to trace a session to an exact tunnel replica — or Mesh node replica — when you run multiple replicas for high availability. The replica ID matches the **Connector ID** shown in the dashboard, so you can [stream that replica's logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/observability/#remote-log-streaming) with `cloudflared tail --connector-id`.

Sessions logged before this change are not backfilled. For all available fields, refer to [Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/).
