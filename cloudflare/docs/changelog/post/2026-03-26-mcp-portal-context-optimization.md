## Context optimization for MCP server portals

[MCP server portals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/ai-controls/mcp-portals/) support two context optimization options that reduce how many tokens tool definitions consume in the model's context window. Both options are activated by appending the `optimize_context` query parameter to the portal URL.

#### `minimize_tools`

Strips tool descriptions and input schemas from all upstream tools, leaving only their names. The portal exposes a special `query` tool that agents use to retrieve full definitions on demand. This provides up to 5x savings in token usage.

#### `search_and_execute`

Hides all upstream tools and exposes only two tools: `query` and `execute`. The `query` tool searches and retrieves tool definitions. The `execute` tool runs the upstream tools in an isolated [Dynamic Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dynamic-workers/) environment. This reduces the initial token cost to a small constant, regardless of how many tools are available through the portal.
