## Images binding is now billed per unique transformation

The [Images binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/) is now billed per unique transformation, matching the model already used for URL-based transformations. Repeat requests for the same combination of source image and parameters within the same calendar month are counted only once.

Previously, every call to the binding counted as a separate transformation regardless of whether the image or parameters were unique. With this change, you can call the binding on hot paths without paying for each individual request.

Calls to [`.info()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/#infostream) are no longer billed.

For more information, refer to [Images pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/pricing/#images-transformed) and the [Images binding documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/binding/).
