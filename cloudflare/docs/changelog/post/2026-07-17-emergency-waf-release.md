This emergency release adds a new managed rule to block active exploitation of a critical remote code execution (RCE) and SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability found in popular web frameworks.

**Key Findings**

  * Generic Frameworks - Unauthenticated RCE: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands with web server privileges by sending malicious input containing invalid path sequences during request processing.

  * Generic Frameworks - SQLi: Attackers can execute unauthorized database queries due to a failure to sanitize input values within request parameters.
