[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/) limits have been raised to the following:

Limit | Previous | New  
---|---|---  
Concurrent instances (running in parallel) | 10,000 | 50,000  
Instance creation rate (per account) | 100/second per account | 300/second per account, 100/second per workflow  
Queued instances per Workflow 1 | 1 million | 2 million  
  
These increases apply to all users on the [Workers Paid plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/). Refer to the [Workflows limits documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/reference/limits/) for more details.

#### Footnotes

  1. Queued instances are instances that have been created or awoken and are waiting for a concurrency slot. ↩
