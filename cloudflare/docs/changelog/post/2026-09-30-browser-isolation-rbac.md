## Role-based access control for Browser Isolation policies

[Isolation policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/isolation-policies/) support role-based access control (RBAC). Because isolation policies are Gateway HTTP policies with the _Isolate_ action, Gateway's account-level and resource-scoped roles apply to them directly.

Use the `Zero Trust HTTP Policies Admin` account-level role to grant access to all HTTP policies in the account. You can also assign a [resource-scoped role](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/granular-permissions/) to let a team member manage a specific isolation policy without exposing other Gateway resources.

[Policy settings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/isolation-policies/#policy-settings) such as copy/paste, file download/upload, keyboard, and printing are part of the policy object and follow the same permissions.

For setup instructions, refer to [Granular permissions for Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/granular-permissions/).
