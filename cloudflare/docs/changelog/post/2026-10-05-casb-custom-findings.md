## Detect organization-specific risks with CASB custom finding types

[Cloudflare CASB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/cloud-and-saas/) now supports [**custom finding types**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/custom-finding-types/), giving security teams full control over the security conditions CASB detects across their SaaS and cloud integrations.

In addition to CASB's library of standard finding types, you can now write your own detection logic using [Rego ↗︎](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/policy-language), the open-source policy language from Open Policy Agent (OPA). Use custom finding types to match your organization's own thresholds and exceptions, such as flagging admin accounts without two-factor authentication, and get higher-confidence findings to act on.

![Create a custom finding type with a name, severity, scope, and Rego detection logic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1194,height=1194,format=webp/_astro/create-custom-finding-type.CF3GXoPZ.png)

#### Key capabilities

  * **Write your own detection logic** — Define exactly what CASB flags using Rego expressions evaluated against asset data from your connected integrations.
  * **Target any supported provider and asset class** — Scope a custom finding type to a provider (such as Google Workspace or Microsoft 365) and asset class (such as users, files, or groups), and apply it to all integrations for that provider or a selected subset.
  * **Built-in validation** — Select **Validate** to check your expression for syntax errors and schema issues before you create the finding type.
  * **Inspect and duplicate standard finding types** — Open any standard finding type to view its detection logic, then duplicate it as the starting point for a custom finding type.
  * **Works with CASB policies** — Use custom finding types in [CASB remediation policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/cloud-and-saas-findings/policies/) to send matching findings to Slack, ServiceNow, or any other webhook destination.



#### Get started

  1. In [Cloudflare One ↗︎](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com), go to **Cloud & SaaS findings** > **Findings library**.
  2. Select **Create finding**.
  3. Enter a name, description, and severity.
  4. Select a provider and asset class, then set the integration scope.
  5. Write your Rego expression and select **Validate**.
  6. Select **Create finding**.



CASB evaluates the custom finding type against assets as they are created or updated within the selected scope. Matching assets appear as posture finding instances under **Posture Findings**.
