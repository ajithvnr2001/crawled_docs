## Account-scoped firewall events dataset in Logpush

Cloudflare Logpush now supports [firewall events as an account-scoped dataset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/firewall_events/). Configure a single Logpush job at the account level to receive firewall events for every zone in the account, instead of creating and maintaining a separate job per zone.

The dataset includes a new [`ZoneName`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/firewall_events/#zonename) field so you can identify which zone each event came from when consuming logs in your downstream pipeline.

#### What's available

  * A new account-scoped `firewall_events` dataset, configurable via the [Logpush API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/logpush/subresources/jobs/) or the Cloudflare dashboard.
  * The same fields and filter expressions supported by the existing [zone-scoped firewall events dataset](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/firewall_events/), plus the new `ZoneName` field.
  * Support for all existing Logpush destinations.
