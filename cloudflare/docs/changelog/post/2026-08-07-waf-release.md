This release updates WordPress XSS rule metadata in the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset and Cloudflare Free Ruleset to identify XSS2Shell (CVE-2026-64638). It also disables the Command Injection - Obfuscation rule.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-64638: A pre-authentication reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability affecting the WordPress login screen. Exploitation requires social engineering and explicit interaction by the target user. Under additional conditions, it may be escalated to remote code execution.



**Impact**

The WordPress changes update rule metadata only; detection behavior and actions remain unchanged.
