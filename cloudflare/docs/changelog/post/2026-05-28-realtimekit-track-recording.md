## Record specific participant audio tracks in RealtimeKit

You can now record specific participant audio tracks in RealtimeKit with [track recording](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/recording-guide/track-recording/). Track recording creates separate WebM files for each participant instead of a single composite recording, which is useful for post-processing, transcription, and regulated or content-sensitive workflows.

To record specific participants, pass `user_ids` when starting a track recording:
    
    
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account_id>/realtime/kit/<app_id>/recordings/track \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer <api_token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
      "meeting_id": "97440c6a-140b-40a9-9499-b23fd7a3868a",
      "user_ids": ["user-123", "user-456"]
    }'

To pass `user_ids` for selective track recording, use the following minimum SDK versions:

  * Web Core: `@cloudflare/realtimekit` version `1.4.0` or later
  * Web UI Kit: `@cloudflare/realtimekit-ui`, `@cloudflare/realtimekit-react-ui`, or `@cloudflare/realtimekit-angular-ui` version `1.1.2` or later
  * Android Core or iOS Core: version `2.0.0` or later
  * Android UI Kit or iOS UI Kit: version `1.1.0` or later
