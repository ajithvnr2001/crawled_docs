[Artifacts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/), Cloudflare's versioned file system that speaks Git, is now in open beta. Artifacts is built for scale, so you can create a repository per project, user, session, or task.

With Artifacts, you can:

  * **Deploy repositories to Workers** — Connect an Artifacts repository through [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/artifacts-integration/). Pushes to the production branch deploy the updated Worker, while other branches create or update [Worker Previews](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/).
  * **Programmatically manage repositories** — Use an [Artifacts binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/api/workers-binding/) from a Worker to create or fork repos, inspect files and commits, read files by path, and issue repo-scoped Git tokens.
  * **React to repository changes** — [Subscribe to events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/event-subscriptions/) when a repository is created, imported, forked, deleted, pushed to, cloned, or fetched.
  * **Control where repository data is stored** — Choose to [store and process](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/data-localization/) your data in the US or EU.
  * **Monitor repository usage** — View total operations, pulls, pushes, errors, and error rates in the Cloudflare dashboard or [via API for analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/observability/metrics/).



Artifacts is available for customers on the Workers Paid plan. Cloudflare will begin [billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/platform/pricing/) for Artifacts on October 14, 2026.
