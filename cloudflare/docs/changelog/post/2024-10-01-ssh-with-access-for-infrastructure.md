## Eliminate long-lived credentials and enhance SSH security with Cloudflare Access for Infrastructure

Organizations can now eliminate long-lived credentials from their SSH setup and enable strong multi-factor authentication for SSH access, similar to other Access applications, all while generating access and command logs.

SSH with [Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/) uses short-lived SSH certificates from Cloudflare, eliminating SSH key management and reducing the security risks associated with lost or stolen keys. It also leverages a common deployment model for Cloudflare One customers: [WARP-to-Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/use-cases/ssh/ssh-device-client/).

SSH with Access for Infrastructure enables you to:

  * **Author fine-grained policy** to control who may access your SSH servers, including specific ports, protocols, and SSH users.
  * **Monitor infrastructure access** with Access and SSH command logs, supporting regulatory compliance and providing visibility in case of security breach.
  * **Preserve your end users' workflows.** SSH with Access for Infrastructure supports native SSH clients and does not require any modifications to users’ SSH configs.
