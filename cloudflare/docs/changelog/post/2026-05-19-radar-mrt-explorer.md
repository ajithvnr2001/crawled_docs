## MRT Explorer on Cloudflare Radar

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now includes an [MRT Explorer ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/mrt-explorer) tool in the Routing section. Route collectors like RIPE RIS and RouteViews publish MRT (Multi-Threaded Routing Toolkit) dump files containing BGP announcements, withdrawals, and route attributes. The new tool parses these files entirely in the browser — nothing gets uploaded.

#### Loading a file

Paste a URL to fetch an MRT file remotely, drag and drop one onto the page, or browse for a local file. Gzip and bzip2 compressed files are supported. A sample file is also available to get started right away.

#### Inspecting events

Once parsed, the tool lists every BGP event with its timestamp, prefix, AS path, OTC (Only to Customer), and community attributes.

#### Event details

Clicking on the "View details" action opens a modal with additional properties and the full event JSON.

#### Shareable URLs

When loading a file by URL, the query string captures the source so the link can be shared directly — the recipient's browser immediately fetches and parses the same file.
