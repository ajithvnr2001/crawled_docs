[Cursor self-hosted machines ↗︎](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted) let you run Cursor Cloud Agents on Cloudflare. Each assigned session runs in its own isolated environment backed by [Cloudflare Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/).

Cursor hosts the agent loop, inference, and planning. Cloudflare runs commands, file edits, repository operations, and other tools inside infrastructure that you control. The open-source [Cursor Cloudflare Workers template ↗︎](https://github.com/anysphere/cloudflare-workers) deploys the Worker, Durable Object namespace, container application, R2 bucket binding, and cron trigger used by the integration.
