## Handle incoming request cancellation in Workers with Request.signal

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

In Cloudflare Workers, you can now attach an event listener to [`Request`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/) objects, using the [`signal` property ↗︎](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/signal). This allows you to perform tasks when the request to your Worker is canceled by the client. To use this feature, you must set the [`enable_request_signal`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#enable-requestsignal-for-incoming-requests) compatibility flag.

You can use a listener to perform cleanup tasks or write to logs before your Worker's invocation ends. For example, if you run the Worker below, and then abort the request from the client, a log will be written:

index.jsjs
    
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    		// This sets up an event listener that will be called if the client disconnects from your
    		// worker.
    		request.signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
    			console.log("The request was aborted!");
    		});
    
    		const { readable, writable } = new IdentityTransformStream();
    		sendPing(writable);
    		return new Response(readable, {
    			headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
    		});
    	},
    };
    
    async function sendPing(writable) {
    	const writer = writable.getWriter();
    	const enc = new TextEncoder();
    
    	for (;;) {
    		// Send 'ping' every second to keep the connection alive
    		await writer.write(enc.encode("ping\r\n"));
    		await scheduler.wait(1000);
    	}
    }

index.tsts
    
    
    export default {
      async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
        // This sets up an event listener that will be called if the client disconnects from your
        // worker.
        request.signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
          console.log('The request was aborted!');
        });
    
        const { readable, writable } = new IdentityTransformStream();
        sendPing(writable);
        return new Response(readable, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' } });
      },
    } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
    
    async function sendPing(writable: WritableStream): Promise<void> {
    	const writer = writable.getWriter();
    	const enc = new TextEncoder();
    
    	for (;;) {
    		// Send 'ping' every second to keep the connection alive
    		await writer.write(enc.encode('ping\r\n'));
    		await scheduler.wait(1000);
    	}
    }
