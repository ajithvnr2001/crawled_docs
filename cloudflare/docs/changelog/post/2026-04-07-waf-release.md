This week's release introduces new detections for a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in MCP Server (CVE-2026-23744), alongside targeted protection for an authentication bypass vulnerability in SolarWinds products (CVE-2025-40552). Additionally, this release includes a new generic detection rule designed to identify and block Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) injection attempts leveraging "OnEvent" handlers within HTTP cookies.

**Key Findings**

  * MCP Server (CVE-2026-23744): A vulnerability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation where malformed input payloads can trigger a memory corruption state, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

  * SolarWinds (CVE-2025-40552): A critical flaw in the authentication module allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security filters and gain unauthorized access to the management console due to improper identity token validation.

  * XSS OnEvents Cookies: This generic rule identifies malicious event handlers (such as onload or onerror) embedded within HTTP cookie values.




**Impact**

Successful exploitation of the MCP Server and SolarWinds vulnerabilities could allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code or gain administrative control, leading to a full system takeover. Additionally, the new generic XSS detection prevents attackers from leveraging browser event handlers in cookies to hijack user sessions or execute malicious scripts.
