## Workers AI toMarkdown and AI Search now supports GIF and BMP image conversion

Workers AI [Markdown conversion](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/) (`toMarkdown`) now supports `.gif` and `.bmp` image files, in addition to the JPEG, PNG, WebP, and SVG formats already supported.

GIF and BMP files run through the same [image pipeline](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/how-it-works/#images) as other formats. Each image is resized if needed (and for animated GIFs, only the first frame is used), then passed to an object-detection model to identify what it contains. Those detected objects prompt a vision model that writes a natural-language description of the image, which becomes searchable, machine-readable Markdown.

[AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/) uses `toMarkdown` automatically to process the files it ingests, so any `.gif` and `.bmp` files are included the next time your index syncs, with no configuration changes required. This helps when your content mixes formats, for example a support knowledge base full of screenshots or an archive of BMP scans.
