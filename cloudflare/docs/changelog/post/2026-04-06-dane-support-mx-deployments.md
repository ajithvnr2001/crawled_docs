## DANE Support for MX Deployments

[Email security](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/)

Cloudflare Email Security now supports DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) for MX deployments. This enhancement strengthens email transport security by enabling DNSSEC-backed certificate verification for our regional MX records.

  * Regional MX hostnames now publish DANE TLSA records backed by DNSSEC, enabling DANE-capable SMTP senders to cryptographically validate certificate identities before establishing TLS connections—moving beyond opportunistic encryption to verified encrypted delivery.
  * DANE support is automatically available for all customers using regional MX deployments. No additional configuration is required; DANE-capable mail infrastructure will automatically validate MX certificates using the published records.



This applies to all Email Security packages:

  * **Advantage**
  * **Enterprise**
  * **Enterprise + PhishGuard**
