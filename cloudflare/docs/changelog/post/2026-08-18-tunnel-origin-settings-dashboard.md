You can now configure origin application settings directly in the Cloudflare dashboard when adding or editing a published application route for a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/). These settings control how `cloudflared` connects to your origin server and were previously only available in the Cloudflare One dashboard or via local configuration files.

When editing a published application, expand **Additional application settings** to configure parameters organized into three categories:

  * **HTTP** — Set a custom HTTP Host header or disable chunked encoding.
  * **TLS** — Configure origin server name, CA pool, TLS timeout, disable TLS verification, match SNI to host, or enable HTTP/2 to origin.
  * **Connection** — Tune connect timeout, keep-alive timeout, keep-alive connections, TCP keep-alive interval, proxy type, or disable Happy Eyeballs.
