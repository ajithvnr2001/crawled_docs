A new Beta release for the macOS Cloudflare One Client is now available on the [beta releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/beta-releases/).

This beta release introduces upgraded security of device registration to be hardware-backed. Registration tokens can now be generated in the Secure Enclave whenever available to provide stronger protection against device impersonation.

**Additional changes and improvements**

This release also introduces multiple fixes and improvements including:

  * Improved accessibility by using high contrast colors and more defined color boundaries when high contrast is enabled in the macOS Display settings.
  * Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is now enabled by default.
  * Fixed an issue where DNS queries would fail after the connection was idle, requiring users to retry.
  * Users can now register with team names in any case format without errors.
  * New UI fixes 
    * Fixed an issue where users with invalid MDM configurations were returned to the onboarding screen after successful authentication.
    * Added a re-auth button and banner to the home screen so users don't miss it when their session expires.
    * Added clear error messaging when the Cloudflare certificate needs to be installed.
    * Brought back support for pausing the tunnel when connected to user-specified Wi-Fi networks for consumer users.
    * New client UI now surfaces Split tunnel configuration and Local Domain Fallback configuration.
    * Added ability to configure proxy mode for consumer users.
    * Added back the option to quit for consumer users.



**Known issues**

  * Registration may hang at "Checking your organization configuration" due to IPC errors. A system reboot should resolve the error, allowing registration to proceed.
