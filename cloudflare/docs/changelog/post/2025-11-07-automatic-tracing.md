## Workers automatic tracing, now in open beta

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Enable automatic tracing on your Workers, giving you detailed metadata and timing information for every operation your Worker performs.

![Tracing example](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1920,height=1080,format=webp/_astro/R2_Screenshot.DAnOidMq.png)

Tracing helps you identify performance bottlenecks, resolve errors, and understand how your Worker interacts with other services on the Workers platform. You can now answer questions like:

  * Which calls are slowing down my application?
  * Which queries to my database take the longest?
  * What happened within a request that resulted in an error?



**You can now:**

  * View traces alongside your logs in the Workers Observability dashboard
  * Export traces (and correlated logs) to any [OTLP-compatible destination ↗︎](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/), such as [Honeycomb](https://developers.cloudflare.com/observability/export/opentelemetry/honeycomb/), [Sentry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/observability/export/opentelemetry/sentry/), or [Grafana](https://developers.cloudflare.com/observability/export/opentelemetry/grafana-cloud/), by configuring a tracing destination in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/observability/destinations)
  * Analyze and query across span attributes (operation type, status, duration, errors)



#### To get started, set:
    
    
    {
    	"observability": {
    		"traces": {
    			"enabled": true,
    		},
    	},
    }

Note

In the future, Cloudflare plans to enable automatic tracing in addition to logs when you set `observability.enabled = true` in your Wrangler configuration.

While automatic tracing is in early beta, this setting will not enable tracing by default, and will only enable logs.

An updated [`compatibility_date`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) will be required for this change to take effect.
