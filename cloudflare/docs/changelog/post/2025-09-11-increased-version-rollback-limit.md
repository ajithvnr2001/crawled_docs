The number of recent versions available for a Worker rollback has been increased from 10 to 100.

This allows you to:

  * Promote any of the 100 most recent versions to be the active deployment.

  * Split traffic using [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/) between your latest code and any of the 100 most recent versions.




You can do this through the Cloudflare dashboard or with [Wrangler's rollback command](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/general/#rollback)
