## Fine-grained Permissioning for Access for Apps, IdPs, & Targets now in Public Beta

[Cloudflare Fundamentals](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/)[Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/)

Fine-grained permissions for **Access Applications, Identity Providers (IdPs), and Targets** is now available in Public Beta. This expands our RBAC model beyond account & zone-scoped roles, enabling administrators to grant permissions scoped to individual resources.

#### What's New

  * **[Access Applications ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/)**: Grant admin permissions to specific Access Applications.
  * **[Identity Providers ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/)**: Grant admin permissions to individual Identity Providers.
  * **[Targets ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/#1-add-a-target)**: Grant admin rights to specific Targets

Note

During the public beta, members must also be assigned an account-scoped, read only role to view resources in the dashboard. This restriction will be lifted in a future release.

  * **Account Read Only** plus a fine-grained permission for a specific App, IdP, or Target
  * **Cloudflare Zero Trust Read Only** plus fine-grained permission for a specific App, IdP, or Target
