## Query R2 Data Catalog tables with R2 SQL from the dashboard

You can now query your [R2 Data Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/) tables with [R2 SQL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-sql/) directly from the Cloudflare dashboard, without installing a CLI or wiring up a client. This makes it easy to explore your [Apache Iceberg ↗︎](https://iceberg.apache.org/) data, validate queries, and inspect results in one place.

![R2 SQL Query Editor](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=3080,height=1696,format=webp/_astro/r2-sql-studio.DCmHJaqy.png)

To get started, go to [R2 Data Catalog ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/data-catalog/overview) in the Cloudflare dashboard and select **Query data** to launch the built-in SQL editor. From there you can:

  * **Write and run queries interactively** — Iterate on R2 SQL directly in the browser with syntax highlighting and autocomplete, instead of re-running commands through Wrangler or the REST API.
  * **Explore your data** — Explore your namespaces and tables alongside the editor so you can discover what's queryable without leaving the page or using other tools.
  * **Understand results and performance** — View result sets with per-query statistics, export them, and get helpful `EXPLAIN` outputs to see exactly how a query runs.



Note

Your R2 SQL credential is generated and stored for you and can be rotated in the R2 Data Catalog settings page.
