Starting in 2027, Cloudflare will deprecate 32-bit Windows and Intel-based macOS builds of `cloudflared`. After the deprecation takes effect, Cloudflare will no longer publish new `cloudflared` releases for either architecture.

Windows 10, the last Windows release to support 32-bit systems, reached end of support in October 2025. Apple has also deprecated Intel-based Mac computers. macOS 26 Tahoe, released in September 2025, was the final macOS release to support Intel-based Macs. macOS 27, released in September 2026, no longer supports them.

Focusing development on currently supported architectures allows `cloudflared` to align with operating system support and continue receiving updates on supported platforms. For available downloads and supported platforms, refer to the [Cloudflare Tunnel downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) documentation.
