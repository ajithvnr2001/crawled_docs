## Updated Email security roles

[Email security](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/)

To provide more granular controls, we refined the [existing roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/roles-permissions/#email-security-roles) for Email security and launched a new Email security role as well.

All Email security roles no longer have read or write access to any of the other Zero Trust products:

  * **Email Configuration Admin**
  * **Email Integration Admin**
  * **Email security Read Only**
  * **Email security Analyst**
  * **Email security Policy Admin**
  * **Email security Reporting**



To configure [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/policies/outbound/outbound-dlp/) or [Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/#set-up-clientless-web-isolation), you now need to be an admin for the Zero Trust dashboard with the **Cloudflare Zero Trust** role.

Also through customer feedback, we have created a new additive role to allow **Email security Analyst** to create, edit, and delete Email security policies, without needing to provide access via the **Email Configuration Admin** role. This role is called **Email security Policy Admin** , which can read all settings, but has write access to [allow policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/policies/inbound/allow-policies/), [trusted domains](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/policies/inbound/trusted-domains/), and [blocked senders](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/policies/inbound/blocked-senders/).

This feature is available across these Email security packages:

  * **Advantage**
  * **Enterprise**
  * **Enterprise + PhishGuard**
