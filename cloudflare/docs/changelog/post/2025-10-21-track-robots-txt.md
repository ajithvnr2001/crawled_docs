## New Robots.txt tab for tracking crawler compliance

[AI Crawl Control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/)

AI Crawl Control now includes a **Robots.txt** tab that provides insights into how AI crawlers interact with your `robots.txt` files.

#### What's new

The Robots.txt tab allows you to:

  * Monitor the health status of `robots.txt` files across all your hostnames, including HTTP status codes, and identify hostnames that need a `robots.txt` file.
  * Track the total number of requests to each `robots.txt` file, with breakdowns of successful versus unsuccessful requests.
  * Check whether your `robots.txt` files contain [Content Signals ↗︎](https://contentsignals.org/) directives for AI training, search, and AI input.
  * Identify crawlers that request paths explicitly disallowed by your `robots.txt` directives, including the crawler name, operator, violated path, specific directive, and violation count.
  * Filter `robots.txt` request data by crawler, operator, category, and custom time ranges.



#### Take action

When you identify non-compliant crawlers, you can:

  * Block the crawler in the [Crawlers tab](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/manage-ai-crawlers/)
  * Create custom [WAF rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/) for path-specific security
  * Use [Redirect Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/) to guide crawlers to appropriate areas of your site



To get started, go to **AI Crawl Control** > **Robots.txt** in the Cloudflare dashboard. Learn more in the [Track robots.txt documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/track-robots-txt/).
