Fine-grained permissions for **Access policies** and **Access service tokens** are available. These new resource-scoped roles expand the existing RBAC model, enabling administrators to grant permissions scoped to individual resources.

#### New roles

  * **Cloudflare Access policy admin** : Can edit a specific [Access policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/) in an account.
  * **Cloudflare Access service token admin** : Can edit a specific [Access service token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/) in an account.



These roles complement the existing resource-scoped roles for Access applications, identity providers, and infrastructure targets.
