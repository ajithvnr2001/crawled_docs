Cloudflare DLP now includes a new predefined profile designed to detect PII records that contain multiple types of personal data: **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Record**.

Most predefined and custom DLP profiles match when any enabled detection entry matches. The **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Record** profile is different. It only matches when at least three unique detection entries are found in close proximity, which reduces false positives from standalone values that may not represent a real PII record.

Detection entries included in the profile:

  * AU Passport Number
  * American Express Card Number
  * Diners Club Card Number
  * US Driver's License Number
  * Email Address
  * Full Name
  * US Mailing Address
  * Mastercard Card Number
  * US Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN)
  * US Passport Number
  * US Phone Number
  * Union Pay Card Number
  * United States SSN Numeric Detection
  * Visa Card Number
