## Filter Workers' public Internet traffic using Gateway policies

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/)[Workers VPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Workers using a [VPC Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/configuration/vpc-networks/) binding with `network_id: "cf1:network"` now egress to public Internet destinations through [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/). This means your existing Zero Trust traffic policies — DNS, HTTP, Network, and egress — extend to traffic that originates from your Workers, the same way they do for WARP users today.

  1. [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Calls `env.EGRESS.fetch()`

  2. [VPC binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/)↓
  3. [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/)

Bind via [`cf1:network`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/configuration/vpc-networks/)

  5. [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

Policies applied:

[DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/dns-policies/)[HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/)[Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/)

  7. ↗Public Internet

Any public hostname or IP


[Gateway logsDNSHTTPNetwork](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/gateway-logs/)

What you get by default:

  * **Visibility.** Worker egress shows up in Gateway [DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/dns-policies/), [HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/), and [Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/) logs alongside your other traffic, so you can audit what your Workers are calling and when.
  * **Enforcement.** Any existing Gateway policy whose selectors match a Worker request will apply — including allow / block lists, DNS category filtering, and HTTP destination rules. If you have already blocked a category for your workforce, your Workers inherit that block.
