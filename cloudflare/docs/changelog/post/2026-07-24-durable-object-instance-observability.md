[Workers Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/) and [OpenTelemetry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/observability/export/opentelemetry/) spans for [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) requests include the Durable Object instance ID.

Use `$workers.durableObjectId` to filter logs for a specific instance. Root and child spans include the same ID in `cloudflare.durable_object.id`.
