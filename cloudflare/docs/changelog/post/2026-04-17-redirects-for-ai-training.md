## Introducing Redirects for AI Training

[AI Crawl Control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/)

Cloudflare's network now supports redirecting verified AI training crawlers to canonical URLs when they request deprecated or duplicate pages. When enabled via **AI Crawl Control** > **Quick Actions** , AI training crawlers that request a page with a canonical tag pointing elsewhere receive a 301 redirect to the canonical version. Humans, search engine crawlers, and AI Search agents continue to see the original page normally.

This feature leverages your existing `<link rel="canonical">` tags. No additional configuration required beyond enabling the toggle. Available on Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans at no additional cost.

Refer to the [Redirects for AI Training documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/reference/redirects-for-ai-training/) for details.
