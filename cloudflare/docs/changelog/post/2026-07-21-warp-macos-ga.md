## Cloudflare One Client for macOS (version 2026.6.880.0)

A new GA release for the macOS Cloudflare One Client is now available on the [stable releases downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/download/).

This hotfix resolves a regression that caused a large increase in DNS-over-TCP queries to fallback and internal DNS servers. The client now sends fallback DNS queries over UDP first, falling back to TCP only when a response is truncated, instead of querying both protocols in parallel.
