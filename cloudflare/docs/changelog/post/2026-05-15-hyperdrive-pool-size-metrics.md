## Hyperdrive exposes database connection pool size metrics

You can now view the size of your Hyperdrive database connection pools, giving you the ability to self-diagnose connection issues. Using the Cloudflare dashboard or the `hyperdrivePoolSizesAdaptiveGroups` dataset in the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/), you can see `waitingClients`, `currentPoolSize`, `availablePoolSlots`, and `maxPoolSize` for each of your configurations.

A new **Pool connections** chart has been added to the **Metrics** tab of each Hyperdrive configuration in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com). You can use the location selector to drill down into specific locations hosting your connection pool by airport code.

The chart shows:

  * **Waiting clients** : Client requests waiting for an available connection.
  * **Open connections** : Active connections to your database.
  * **Pool size maximum** : Your configured origin connection limit.



Connection contention appears as a spike in waiting clients, or when open connections consistently approach the pool size maximum. If your open connections regularly approach this limit, consider contacting Cloudflare to [increase your Hyperdrive connection limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/platform/limits/#request-a-limit-increase).

#### Pool size metrics

The `hyperdrivePoolSizesAdaptiveGroups` dataset in the [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started/) exposes the following key connection pool metrics for each Hyperdrive configuration:

Under `avg`:

  * **`currentPoolSize`** — Average number of connections currently open in the pool.
  * **`availablePoolSlots`** — Average number of pool connections available for checkout.
  * **`waitingClients`** — Average number of clients waiting for a connection from the pool.



Under `max`:

  * **`maxPoolSize`** — Configured maximum size of the connection pool.
  * **`currentPoolSize`** — Peak number of connections open in the pool.
  * **`waitingClients`** — Peak number of clients waiting for a connection from the pool.
