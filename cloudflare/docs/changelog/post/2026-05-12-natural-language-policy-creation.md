## Create Gateway firewall policies with natural language

[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)

Cloudflare Gateway now supports natural language policy creation for [DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/dns-policies/), [HTTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/http-policies/), and [Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/network-policies/) firewall policies. Administrators can describe the outcome they want in plain language, and Cloudflare will generate a complete policy rule that populates the policy builder form.

![Create with AI button on the Gateway firewall policies page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=2360,height=1088,format=webp/_astro/gateway-create-with-ai.BYG07coh.png)

To create a policy with natural language, select **Create with AI** on any Gateway firewall policy tab. Choose a policy type, describe what the policy should do, and a fully configured rule will appear in the policy builder for review. You can edit any field before saving, or re-generate with a different prompt.

The generated policy incorporates your account context - including lists, DLP profiles, applications, and device posture checks - so that references to your existing resources resolve automatically.

A built-in feedback mechanism allows you to rate each generated policy and provide optional comments, which Cloudflare uses to improve output quality over time.
