Billing is now enabled for [R2 Data Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/) on non-enterprise accounts. R2 Data Catalog usage beyond the included free tier will appear on your next invoice.

R2 Data Catalog charges based on two dimensions, in addition to standard [R2 storage and operations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/):

  * **Catalog operations** : $9.00 / million operations for metadata requests such as creating tables, reading table metadata, and updating table properties.
  * **Compaction** : $0.005 / GB processed and $2.00 / million objects processed. These charges only apply when [automatic compaction](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/table-maintenance/) is turned on for a table.



Each dimension includes a monthly free tier: 1 million catalog operations, 10 GB of compaction data processed, and 1 million compaction objects processed.

For example, a single Iceberg table with 50 GB of data, 500,000 catalog operations per month, and compaction turned on that processes 20 GB across 200,000 files would be billed as follows:

Dimension | Usage | Included | Billable | Cost  
---|---|---|---|---  
Catalog operations | 500,000 | 1,000,000 | 0 | $0.00  
Compaction (data processed) | 20 GB | 10 GB | 10 GB | $0.05  
Compaction (objects) | 200,000 | 1,000,000 | 0 | $0.00  
**Total (Data Catalog)** |  |  |  | **$0.05**  
  
Standard R2 storage charges ($0.015 / GB-month) apply separately for the 50 GB of data stored.
