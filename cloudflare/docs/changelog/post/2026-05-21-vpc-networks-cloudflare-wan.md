## Reach Cloudflare WAN destinations from Workers VPC

[Workers VPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can now use [VPC Network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/configuration/vpc-networks/) bindings with `network_id: "cf1:network"` to reach your full private network from Workers, including:

  * [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/) nodes and client devices
  * Subnet routes and hostname routes announced through [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) or Cloudflare Mesh
  * Destinations connected through [Cloudflare WAN](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/) on-ramps — GRE, IPsec, and CNI



This means a single VPC Network binding can route Worker requests to private services regardless of how those services are connected to Cloudflare: through a Cloudflare Tunnel from a cloud VPC, a Mesh node on a private subnet, or a Cloudflare WAN on-ramp from your data center or branch site.
    
    
    {
    	"vpc_networks": [
    		{
    			"binding": "PRIVATE_NETWORK",
    			"network_id": "cf1:network",
    			"remote": true,
    		},
    	],
    }
    
    
    [[vpc_networks]]
    binding = "PRIVATE_NETWORK"
    network_id = "cf1:network"
    remote = true

At runtime, the URL you pass to `fetch()` determines the destination:
    
    
    // Reach a service behind a Cloudflare WAN IPsec on-ramp
    const response = await env.PRIVATE_NETWORK.fetch("http://10.50.0.100:8080/api");

Note

For destinations behind Cloudflare WAN on-ramps (GRE, IPsec, or CNI), your network must route the [Cloudflare source IP range](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-wan/configuration/how-to/configure-cloudflare-source-ips/) back through the on-ramp so reply traffic returns to Cloudflare. Without this route, stateful flows will fail. This is part of standard Cloudflare WAN onboarding.

For configuration options, refer to [VPC Networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/configuration/vpc-networks/).
