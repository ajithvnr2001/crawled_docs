**Passive Detection** for [Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/) lets you learn from your Gateway traffic before deciding what to log or block. Discover the sensitive data types in sampled traffic, explore their destinations, and use the findings to build policies around your organization's needs.

The dashboard brings together detections from sampled HTTP request and response bodies. Select an entry to follow its detections over time, review destinations, and check policy coverage. You do not need a Gateway DLP policy to get these insights, and existing Gateway policies continue to apply.

Passive Detection is generally available. The detection entries available to your account depend on your [Zero Trust plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/predefined-profiles/).

To get started, refer to the [Passive Detection documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/passive-detection/).
