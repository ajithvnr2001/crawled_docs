Flows are automated rules that pair conditions (such as file extension, URL path, or query parameter) with parameters. Set up a flow to automatically apply image optimization to matching requests on your zone without writing code or changing URLs.

There are two modes for transformation flows:

  * **[Provider flows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/flows/#set-up-a-provider-flow)** — Migrate from another image optimization service. Your existing URLs continue to work while Cloudflare rewrites provider-specific parameters to their Cloudflare equivalents. Currently, Cloudflare supports provider flows for Fastly Image Optimizer.
  * **[Custom flows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/transformations/flows/#set-up-a-custom-flow)** — Define your own conditions and actions for use cases like automatic format conversion, [responsive sizing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/optimization/make-responsive-images/#using-widthauto) with `width=auto`, or directory-based optimization.



To get started, go to **Images** > **Transformations** > **Automation** in the [Cloudflare dashboard ↗︎](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/transformations).
