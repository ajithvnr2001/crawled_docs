## Verify WARP Connector connectivity with a simple ping

We have made it easier to validate connectivity when deploying [WARP Connector](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/) as part of your [software-defined private network](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/sase/#connecting-networks).

You can now `ping` the WARP Connector host directly on its LAN IP address immediately after installation. This provides a fast, familiar way to confirm that the Connector is online and reachable within your network before testing access to downstream services.

Starting with [version 2025.10.186.0](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-01-13-warp-linux-ga/), WARP Connector responds to traffic addressed to its own LAN IP, giving you immediate visibility into Connector reachability.
