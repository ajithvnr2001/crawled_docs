## Routing Section Expansion on Cloudflare Radar

[Radar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

[**Radar**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/) now features an expanded [Routing section ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing) with dedicated sub-pages, providing a more organized and in-depth view of the global routing ecosystem. This restructuring lays the groundwork for additional routing features and widgets coming in the near future.

#### Dedicated sub-pages

The single Routing page has been split into three focused sub-pages:

  * [**Overview** ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing) — Routing statistics, IP address space trends, BGP announcements, and the new Top 100 ASes ranking.
  * [**RPKI** ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/rpki) — RPKI validation status, ASPA deployment trends, and per-ASN ASPA provider details.
  * [**Anomalies** ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/anomalies) — BGP route leaks, origin hijacks, and Multi-Origin AS (MOAS) conflicts.

#### New widgets

The routing overview now includes a **Top 100 ASes** table ranking autonomous systems by customer cone size, IPv4 address space, or IPv6 address space. Users can switch between rankings using a segmented control.

The RPKI sub-page introduces a **RPKI validation** view for per-ASN pages, showing prefixes grouped by RPKI validation status (Valid, Invalid, Unknown) with visibility scores.

#### Improved IP address space chart

The [IP address space ↗︎](https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing) chart now displays both IPv4 and IPv6 trends stacked vertically and is available on global, country, and AS views.
