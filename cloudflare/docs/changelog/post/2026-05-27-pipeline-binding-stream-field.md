## Pipeline binding configuration field renamed to stream

The `pipeline` field inside the `pipelines` binding configuration in your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) has been renamed to `stream`. The old field is deprecated but still accepted.

Update your configuration to use `stream` to avoid the deprecation warning.

**Before (deprecated):**
    
    
    {
      "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
      "pipelines": [
        {
          "binding": "MY_PIPELINE",
          "pipeline": "<STREAM_ID>"
        }
      ]
    }
    
    
    [[pipelines]]
    binding = "MY_PIPELINE"
    pipeline = "<STREAM_ID>"

**After:**
    
    
    {
      "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
      "pipelines": [
        {
          "binding": "MY_PIPELINE",
          "stream": "<STREAM_ID>"
        }
      ]
    }
    
    
    [[pipelines]]
    binding = "MY_PIPELINE"
    stream = "<STREAM_ID>"

No other changes are required. The binding name, TypeScript types, and runtime API (`env.MY_PIPELINE.send(...)`) remain the same.
