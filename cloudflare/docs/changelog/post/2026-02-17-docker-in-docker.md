## Docker-in-Docker support added to Containers and Sandboxes

[Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/)

[Sandboxes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) and [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/) now support running Docker for "Docker-in-Docker" setups. This is particularly useful when your end users or [agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents) want to run a full sandboxed development environment.

This allows you to:

  * Develop containerized applications with your Sandbox
  * Run isolated test environments for images
  * Build container images as part of CI/CD workflows
  * Deploy arbitrary images supplied at runtime within a container



For [Sandbox SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) users, see the [Docker-in-Docker guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/guides/docker-in-docker/) for instructions on combining Docker with the SandboxSDK. For general Containers usage, see the [Containers FAQ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/faq/#can-i-run-docker-inside-a-container-docker-in-docker).
