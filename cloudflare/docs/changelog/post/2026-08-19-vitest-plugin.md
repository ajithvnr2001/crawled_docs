[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Version 1 of the Workers Vitest integration is published as [`@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/vitest-plugin). The package was formerly named `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.

The Vitest configuration API is unchanged. Existing projects must update the dependency name, package imports, and TypeScript `types` entries.

To migrate automatically, run:

npmyarnpnpm
    
    
    npx @cloudflare/codemods vitest:pool-workers-to-vitest-plugin
    
    
    yarn @cloudflare/codemods vitest:pool-workers-to-vitest-plugin
    
    
    pnpm @cloudflare/codemods vitest:pool-workers-to-vitest-plugin

The codemod updates your dependency, imports, and test TypeScript configuration. For manual migration steps, refer to [Migrate to Vitest plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/migration-guides/migrate-to-vitest-plugin/).

For outbound request mocks in Workers tests, use the [`@msw/cloudflare` ↗︎](https://github.com/mswjs/cloudflare) integration. Refer to [Mock outbound requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/mock-outbound-requests/).
