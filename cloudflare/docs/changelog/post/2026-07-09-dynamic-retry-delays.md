## Workflows now supports delay functions when retrying

[Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/)

With [Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/), you can configure built-in retry behavior for each step. Previously, you could configure step retries with fixed delay durations, such as seconds, minutes, or hours, and backoff strategies such as `constant`, `linear`, or `exponential`.

Step retries now support dynamic delay functions. Instead of choosing only a base delay and backoff strategy, pass a function to `retries.delay` and calculate the next delay from the failed attempt and thrown error.

This is useful when retries should depend on the failure. Your Workflow may need to wait longer after a rate-limit error, but retry sooner after a short network failure. The delay function can also accommodate provider guidance if, for example, a downstream API returns a `Retry-After` value in its error messaging.
    
    
    await step.do(
    	"sync customer",
    	{
    		retries: {
    			limit: 5,
    			delay: ({ ctx, error }) => {
    				if (error.message.includes("rate limit")) {
    					return `${ctx.attempt * 30} seconds`;
    				}
    
    				return "10 seconds";
    			},
    		},
    	},
    	async () => {
    		await syncCustomer();
    	},
    );
    
    
    await step.do(
    	"sync customer",
    	{
    		retries: {
    			limit: 5,
    			delay: ({ ctx, error }) => {
    				if (error.message.includes("rate limit")) {
    					return `${ctx.attempt * 30} seconds`;
    				}
    
    				return "10 seconds";
    			},
    		},
    	},
    	async () => {
    		await syncCustomer();
    	},
    );

Dynamic delay functions can return a duration string, a number, or a promise that resolves to a duration. Use them to add adaptive retry behavior without writing separate queue or scheduling logic.
