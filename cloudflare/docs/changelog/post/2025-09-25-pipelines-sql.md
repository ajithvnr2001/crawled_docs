## Pipelines now supports SQL transformations and Apache Iceberg

Today, we are launching the new [Cloudflare Pipelines](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/): a streaming data platform that ingests events, transforms them with [SQL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/sql-reference/select-statements/), and writes to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) as [Apache Iceberg ↗︎](https://iceberg.apache.org/) tables or Parquet files.

Pipelines can receive events via [HTTP endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/streams/writing-to-streams/#send-via-http) or [Worker bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/streams/writing-to-streams/#send-via-workers), transform them with SQL, and deliver to R2 with exactly-once guarantees. This makes it easy to build analytics-ready warehouses for server logs, mobile application events, IoT telemetry, or clickstream data without managing streaming infrastructure.

For example, here is a pipeline that ingests clickstream events and filters out bot traffic while extracting domain information:
    
    
    INSERT into events_table
    SELECT
      user_id,
      lower(event) AS event_type,
      to_timestamp_micros(ts_us) AS event_time,
      regexp_match(url, '^https?://([^/]+)')[1]  AS domain,
      url,
      referrer,
      user_agent
    FROM events_json
    WHERE event = 'page_view'
      AND NOT regexp_like(user_agent, '(?i)bot|spider');

Get started by creating a pipeline in the dashboard or running a single command in [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/):
    
    
    npx wrangler pipelines setup

Check out our [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-pipelines/getting-started/) to learn how to create a pipeline that delivers events to an [Iceberg table](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/) you can query with R2 SQL.
