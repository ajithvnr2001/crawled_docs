Billing is now enabled for [R2 SQL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-sql/) on non-enterprise accounts. R2 SQL usage beyond the included free tier will appear on your next invoice.

R2 SQL charges based on a single dimension:

  * **Data scanned** : $0.0025 / GB ($2.50 / TB) of compressed data read from R2 to execute your query.



All plans include 10 GB of data scanned per month. Each query is billed for a minimum of 10 MB of data scanned. R2 SQL pricing is additive to standard [R2 storage and operations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) and [R2 Data Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/basin-catalog/platform/pricing/) charges. R2 does not charge for egress, so there is no additional data transfer cost.

For example, a user who stores 500 GB of Parquet data in R2 Data Catalog and runs queries that scan a total of 50 GB of compressed data during the month would be billed as follows:

Dimension | Usage | Included | Billable | Cost  
---|---|---|---|---  
R2 storage | 500 GB-month | 10 GB-month | 490 GB-month | $7.35  
R2 SQL (data scanned) | 50 GB | 10 GB | 40 GB | $0.10  
**Total** |  |  |  | **$7.45**
