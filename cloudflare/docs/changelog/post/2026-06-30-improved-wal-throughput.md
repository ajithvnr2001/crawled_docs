## Reduced end-to-end latency for vector changes

We have greatly improved the throughput of the Vectorize [write-ahead log (WAL) ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-vectorize-a-distributed-vector-database-on-cloudflare-developer-platform/#the-wal). As a result, we have significantly reduced the end-to-end latency for a vector change to become queryable: median latency has dropped from 2 minutes to under 30 seconds, and p99 latency from 5 minutes to under 2 minutes.

This means inserts, upserts, and deletes are reflected in query results faster, improving the freshness of semantic search, recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workloads. You do not need to change your code or configuration to benefit from this improvement.
