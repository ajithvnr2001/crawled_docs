## 40-60% Faster D1 Worker API Requests

[D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)

Users making [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) requests via the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/worker-api/) can see up to a 60% end-to-end latency improvement due to the removal of redundant network round trips needed for each request to a D1 database.

![D1 Worker API latency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=4437,height=1754,format=webp/_astro/faster-d1-worker-api.4S7VSUdP.png)

_p50, p90, and p95 request latency aggregated across entire D1 service. These latencies are a reference point and should not be viewed as your exact workload improvement._

This performance improvement benefits all D1 Worker API traffic, especially cross-region requests where network latency is an outsized latency factor. For example, a user in Europe talking to a database in North America. D1 [location hints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/configuration/data-location/#provide-a-location-hint) can be used to influence the geographic location of a database.

For more details on how D1 removed redundant round trips, see the D1 specific release note [entry](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/release-notes/#2025-01-07).
