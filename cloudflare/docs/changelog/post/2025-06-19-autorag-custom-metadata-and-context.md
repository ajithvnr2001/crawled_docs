## View custom metadata in responses and guide AI-search with context in AutoRAG

[AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

In [AutoRAG](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/), you can now view your object's custom metadata in the response from [`/search`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/workers-binding/) and [`/ai-search`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/api/search/workers-binding/), and optionally add a `context` field in the custom metadata of an object to provide additional guidance for AI-generated answers.

You can add [custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-reference/#r2putoptions) to an object when uploading it to your R2 bucket.

#### Object's custom metadata in search responses

When you run a search, AutoRAG now returns any custom metadata associated with the object. This metadata appears in the response inside `attributes` then `file` , and can be used for downstream processing.

For example, the `attributes` section of your search response may look like:
    
    
    {
    	"attributes": {
    		"timestamp": 1750001460000,
    		"folder": "docs/",
    		"filename": "launch-checklist.md",
    		"file": {
    			"url": "https://wiki.company.com/docs/launch-checklist",
    			"context": "A checklist for internal launch readiness, including legal, engineering, and marketing steps."
    		}
    	}
    }

#### Add a `context` field to guide LLM answers

When you include a custom metadata field named `context`, AutoRAG attaches that value to each chunk of the file. When you run an `/ai-search` query, this `context` is passed to the LLM and can be used as additional input when generating an answer.

We recommend using the `context` field to describe supplemental information you want the LLM to consider, such as a summary of the document or a source URL. If you have several different metadata attributes, you can join them together however you choose within the `context` string.

For example:
    
    
    {
    	"context": "summary: 'Checklist for internal product launch readiness, including legal, engineering, and marketing steps.'; url: 'https://wiki.company.com/docs/launch-checklist'"
    }

This gives you more control over how your content is interpreted, without requiring you to modify the original contents of the file.
