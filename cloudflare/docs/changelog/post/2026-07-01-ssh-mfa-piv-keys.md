## Independent MFA for infrastructure applications

[Access for Infrastructure](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/non-http/infrastructure-apps/) now supports independent multi-factor authentication (MFA) for SSH connections using YubiKey PIV keys. This adds a hardware-backed second factor to SSH access, ensuring that a compromised device session alone is not sufficient to reach your servers.

With per-application and per-policy configuration, you can enforce PIV key authentication for sensitive usernames (for example, `root`) while applying different requirements for other usernames. You can also set an MFA session duration to control how often users must re-authenticate.

#### Enrollment

Users enroll their YubiKey PIV key through the [App Launcher](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/app-launcher/). For enrollment instructions and SSH client setup, refer to [Enroll a PIV key for infrastructure apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/independent-mfa/#enroll-a-piv-key-for-infrastructure-apps).

#### Configuration

For setup instructions, refer to [Enforce MFA for infrastructure applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/mfa-requirements/#infrastructure-applications).
