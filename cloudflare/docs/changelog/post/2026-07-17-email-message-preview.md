## Preview sent emails in the Activity log

You can now preview the content of sent emails directly from the Email Service Activity log. Expand a sent email and open the new **Preview** section to inspect the message as it was sent, across tabs for the rendered **HTML** body, the **Text** body, the **Headers** , the **Attachments** , and the full **Raw** [RFC 5322 ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322) source.

Previously, the Activity log surfaced delivery and authentication metadata but not the message content, making rendering and content issues harder to debug. Message preview closes that gap.

To make messages previewable, turn on **Email preview** in your sending domain's settings. Previews cover messages sent while the setting is turned on and are retained for about seven days. Sending domains onboarded on or after 2026-07-02 have **Email preview** turned on automatically.
