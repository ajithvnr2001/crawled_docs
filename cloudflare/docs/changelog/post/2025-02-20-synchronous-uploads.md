## Workers for Platforms - Instant dispatch for newly created User Workers

[Workers for Platforms ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/) is an architecture wherein a centralized [dispatch Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#dynamic-dispatch-worker) processes incoming requests and routes them to isolated sub-Workers, called [User Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/how-workers-for-platforms-works/#user-workers).

Previously, when a new User Worker was uploaded, there was a short delay before it became available for dispatch. This meant that even though an API request could return a 200 OK response, the script might not yet be ready to handle requests, causing unexpected failures for platforms that immediately dispatch to new Workers.

**With this update, first-time uploads of User Workers are now deployed synchronously**. A 200 OK response guarantees the script is fully provisioned and ready to handle traffic immediately, ensuring more predictable deployments and reducing errors.
