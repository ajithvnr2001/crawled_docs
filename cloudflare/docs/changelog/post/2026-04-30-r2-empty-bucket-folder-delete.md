## Empty buckets and delete folders from the R2 dashboard

[R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)

You can now empty an entire [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket or delete folders directly from the dashboard. Emptying a bucket is required before you can delete it. Previously, this required scripting or configuring [lifecycle rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/object-lifecycles/). Now, the dashboard can handle it in a single action.

#### Empty a bucket

Go to your bucket's **Settings** tab and select **Empty** under the **Empty Bucket** section. This deletes all objects in the bucket while preserving the bucket and its configuration. For large buckets, the operation runs in the background and the dashboard displays progress.

Emptying a bucket is also a prerequisite for deleting it. The dashboard now guides you through both steps in one place.

#### Delete folders

R2 uses a flat object structure. The dashboard groups objects that share a common prefix into folders when the **View prefixes as directories** checkbox is selected. Deleting a folder removes every object under that prefix.

From the **Objects** tab, you can select one or more folders and delete them alongside individual objects.

For step-by-step instructions, refer to [Delete buckets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/delete-buckets/) and [Delete objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/objects/delete-objects/).
