## Workers Static Assets: Corrected handling of double slashes in redirect rule paths

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

[Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/): Fixed a bug in how [redirect rules ↗︎](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/redirects/) defined in your Worker's `_redirects` file are processed.

If you're serving Static Assets with a `_redirects` file containing a rule like `/ja/* /:splat`, paths with double slashes were previously misinterpreted as external URLs. For example, visiting `/ja//example.com` would incorrectly redirect to `https://example.com` instead of `/example.com` on your domain. This has been fixed and double slashes now correctly resolve as local paths. Note: [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) was not affected by this issue.
