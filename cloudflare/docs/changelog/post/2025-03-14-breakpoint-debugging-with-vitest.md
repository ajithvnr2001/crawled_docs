## Set breakpoints and debug your Workers tests with @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

You can now debug your Workers tests with our [Vitest integration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/) by running the following command:
    
    
    vitest --inspect --no-file-parallelism

Attach a debugger to the port 9229 and you can start stepping through your Workers tests. This is available with `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` v0.7.5 or later.

Learn more in our [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/debugging/).
