## R2 SQL now supports approximate aggregation functions

R2 SQL now supports five approximate aggregation functions for fast analysis of large datasets. These functions trade minor precision for improved performance on high-cardinality data.

#### New functions

  * `APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT(column, percentile)` — Returns the approximate value at a given percentile (0.0 to 1.0). Works on integer and decimal columns.
  * `APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT_WITH_WEIGHT(column, weight, percentile)` — Weighted percentile calculation where each row contributes proportionally to its weight column value.
  * `APPROX_MEDIAN(column)` — Returns the approximate median. Equivalent to `APPROX_PERCENTILE_CONT(column, 0.5)`.
  * `APPROX_DISTINCT(column)` — Returns the approximate number of distinct values. Works on any column type.
  * `APPROX_TOP_K(column, k)` — Returns the `k` most frequent values with their counts as a JSON array.



All functions support `WHERE` filters. All except `APPROX_TOP_K` support `GROUP BY`.

#### Examples
    
    
    -- Percentile analysis on revenue data
    SELECT approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.25),
           approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.5),
           approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.75)
    FROM my_namespace.sales_data
    
    
    -- Median per department
    SELECT department, approx_median(total_amount)
    FROM my_namespace.sales_data
    GROUP BY department
    
    
    -- Approximate distinct customers by region
    SELECT region, approx_distinct(customer_id)
    FROM my_namespace.sales_data
    GROUP BY region
    
    
    -- Top 5 most frequent departments
    SELECT approx_top_k(department, 5)
    FROM my_namespace.sales_data
    
    
    -- Combine approximate and standard aggregations
    SELECT COUNT(*),
           AVG(total_amount),
           approx_percentile_cont(total_amount, 0.5),
           approx_distinct(customer_id)
    FROM my_namespace.sales_data
    WHERE region = 'North'
