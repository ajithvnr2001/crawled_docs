## [Precursor adds Monitor mode](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-19-precursor-monitor-mode/)

[Bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/)

We released Monitor mode at customers' request so they can test Precursor and the Precursor Interstitial without updating bot score.

In **Security** > **Settings** , the Precursor **Status** dropdown now offers _Off_ , _Monitor_ , and _Arm_. Selecting _Arm_ means Precursor detections can affect bot score and Challenge clearance. Selecting _Monitor_ means Precursor detections do not affect bot score or Challenge clearance.

![Precursor Status dropdown with Off, Monitor, and Arm options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=739,height=235,format=webp/_astro/precursor-monitor-mode-status.CRb5Sudr.png)

We also separated the Precursor Interstitial from the mode. Set the sitewide default with **Show Interstitial** , then add **Interstitial Rules** to customize it for specific requests. For example, leave **Show Interstitial** off across most of your site, but require an interstitial Challenge on `/checkout` to enforce a valid session before purchase.

![Precursor settings with Show Interstitial off and an Open interstitial rules button](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=600,height=441,format=webp/_astro/precursor-interstitial-settings.Bpb_aV0o.png)

For more information, refer to the [**Precursor**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/precursor/) documentation.

## [50,000 routes per account and Tunnels for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-16-tunnels-for-platforms-and-50k-routes/)

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/)[Cloudflare Tunnel for SASE](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/)[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/)[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)

Two changes make it easier to run Cloudflare Tunnel at scale.

#### 50,000 routes per account by default

The default limit for [routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/routes/add-routes/) is now 50,000 per account, up from 1,000. This limit covers [CIDR routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/connect-cidr/) and [hostname routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/connect-private-hostname/) for [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/) and [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/). The new limit applies to every account automatically, with no action required.

Published applications (public hostnames) are not routes and are not affected by this limit. Each tunnel supports roughly 5,000–10,000 published applications, depending on the size of its configuration. For details, refer to [Published application limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/concepts/routing/#published-application-limits).

#### Tunnels for Platforms

Every account includes 1,000 tunnels. With [Tunnels for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/features/tunnels-for-platforms/), you can now run more than 1,000 tunnels in a single account — for example, one tunnel per device, per end customer, or per development environment.

![Buy additional tunnels from the Tunnels page in the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1512,height=802,format=webp/_astro/tunnels-for-platforms.DuPYMNzo.gif)

To buy additional tunnels, go to **Networking** > **Tunnels** and select **Buy more tunnels** in the **Usage** card. Additional tunnels are billed at $4.50 per tunnel per month. Enterprise customers can contact their account team for committed or usage-based pricing.

[ Go to **Tunnels** ↗ ](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/tunnels)

For pricing, limits, and best practices for managing large tunnel fleets, refer to [Tunnels for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/features/tunnels-for-platforms/).

## [Remove surrounding bytes with trim functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-14-trim-functions/)

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

Cloudflare Rules supports three new functions for removing surrounding bytes. Use them to remove whitespace before comparing request values. All HTTP products support these functions on all plans:

  * `trim()` removes bytes from both ends.
  * `trim_start()` removes bytes from the start.
  * `trim_end()` removes bytes from the end.



By default, these functions remove ASCII whitespace. An optional constant string specifies a custom set of bytes.

If the input value is nil, these functions return nil.

For example, this expression removes surrounding whitespace before comparing a header value:
    
    
    trim(http.request.headers["x-label"][0]) eq "approved"

For details, refer to the [`trim()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#trim), [`trim_start()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#trim_start), and [`trim_end()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#trim_end) function references.

## [WAF Release - 2026-10-14 - Emergency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-14-emergency-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This emergency release adds a new managed rule to block active exploitation of a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability found in popular web frameworks.

**Key Findings**

Key Findings

  * Generic Rules - Remote Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands with web server privileges by sending malicious input containing invalid path sequences during request processing.

## [Run schema learning on demand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-12-manual-schema-learning/)

[API Shield](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/)

You can now manually request an API Shield schema learning run without waiting for the weekly schedule. Use this during testing after sending representative traffic to your API.

In **Web Assets** > **Operations** , open the **More options** menu for the operations table and select **Ad-hoc learn schema**. In the **Schema learning** dialog, select **Run learning**. The run covers the entire zone and uses observed traffic. Existing learning thresholds still apply.

The dialog shows the learning status and last completed run for the zone. The **Learned schema** view shows the learning result and last learning run for each operation. You can review individual results while the zone-wide run continues.

For instructions and traffic requirements, refer to [Run schema learning manually](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-management/schema-learning/#run-schema-learning-manually).

## [WAF Release - 2026-10-12](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-12-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This release introduces new detections to mitigate recent vulnerabilities affecting TanStack and Atlassian products.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-102989: A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting TanStack. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized actions.

  * CVE-2026-21589: An arbitrary file access vulnerability affecting Atlassian products. Threat actors can exploit this flaw to read unauthorized files on the target system, risking the exposure of sensitive configuration data.

Oct 9, 2026

## [Failed detections field available in Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-09-failed-detections/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

You can now use `cf.appsec.request.failed_detections` to control how your rules handle requests when a security detection reports a failure.

The field is an `Array<String>` of detection IDs that reports failures from content scanning, WAF attack score, attack signature detection, leaked credentials detection, and AI prompt detections for personally identifiable information (PII), prompt injection, custom topics, and unsafe topics.

The field does not alter the existing behavior of detections. Use it in rules to choose how to handle requests with reported failures.

When no failures are reported, the field returns `[]`. You can use it on all plans, but your plan must still include the detections and rule features you want to use.

Supported rules:

  * Custom rules at the zone and account levels
  * Rate limiting rules at the zone and account levels
  * Request Header Transform Rules at the zone level



Match any reported failure:
    
    
    len(cf.appsec.request.failed_detections) gt 0

Match a reported leaked credentials detection failure:
    
    
    any(cf.appsec.request.failed_detections[*] eq "waf_credential_check")

For more information, refer to the [Failed detections field reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.appsec.request.failed_detections/).

Oct 7, 2026

## [Updated unsafe topic detection for AI Security for Apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-07-ai-security-for-apps-unsafe-topic-detection/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

AI Security for Apps now supports an updated set of categories for detecting unsafe topics in incoming prompts.

The values available in [`cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories/) have changed. Existing WAF custom rules remain valid, but rules that reference a removed or renamed category will no longer match that category. Review any rules that use this field and update their expressions to use the currently supported values.

For category descriptions and configuration guidance, refer to [Unsafe topics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/ai-security-for-apps/unsafe-topics/).

Oct 6, 2026

## [WAF Release - 2026-10-06](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-06-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This release introduces a new detection to mitigate a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in F5 BIG-IP, and enhances existing command injection protections by incorporating tested beta logic into the baseline rule.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-94127: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in F5 BIG-IP. Attackers can exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

Ruleset| Rule ID| Legacy Rule ID| Description| Previous Action| New Action| Comments

## [hash_in_range() is globally available for HTTP products](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-02-hash-in-range-ga/)

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

`hash_in_range()` is globally available for HTTP products on all plans. It hashes fields into an integer within a specified range. Use this result to select a portion of requests.

Use `cf.random_seed` to select approximately 10% of requests at random:
    
    
    hash_in_range(0, 100, cf.random_seed) < 10

With Cloudflare for SaaS, use [custom metadata](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/) to control rollout progression. Define `rollout_pct` as a custom key for each hostname. Set its value to an integer from 0 to 100. The expression selects approximately that percentage of requests:
    
    
    hash_in_range(0, 100, cf.random_seed) < coalesce(lookup_json_integer(cf.hostname.metadata, "rollout_pct"), 0)

If `rollout_pct` is missing, `coalesce()` supplies `0`. The rule then matches no requests.

For details, refer to the [`hash_in_range()` function reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#hash_in_range).

## [Protect Quick Tunnels with email authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-02-protected-quick-tunnels/)

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/)

You can now restrict who can access a [Quick Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/). Use the new `--allowed-mail` flag in `cloudflared` to require visitors to authenticate with a one-time PIN sent to their email before they reach your local service.
    
    
    cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080 --allowed-mail alice@example.com

![Protected Quick Tunnel demo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1512,height=854,format=webp/_astro/protected-quick-tunnels.DlA306r_.gif)

Previously, anyone with a `trycloudflare.com` URL could access the service behind it. Protected Quick Tunnels let you share a local development server, webhook receiver, or demo with specific people without creating a Cloudflare account or configuring a domain.

You can allow:

  * A single email address: `--allowed-mail alice@example.com`
  * Multiple email addresses, by repeating the flag or using a comma-separated list: `--allowed-mail 'alice@example.com,bob@example.com'`
  * Every address on a domain: `--allowed-mail '*@example.com'`



Visitors do not need a Cloudflare account. Access ends for everyone when you stop the `cloudflared` process.

To get started, [update `cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) to the latest version and refer to [Restrict access by email](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/get-started/quick-tunnels/#restrict-access-by-email).

Oct 1, 2026

## [Handle missing values with coalesce()](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-01-coalesce-function/)

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

The `coalesce()` function returns the first argument that is not nil. Use it to provide a fallback in rule expressions:
    
    
    http.request.uri.path eq coalesce(http.request.uri.args["expected_path"][0], "/")

For details, refer to the [`coalesce()` function reference](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#coalesce).

Oct 1, 2026

## [Compare dynamic values in Rules expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-01-dynamic-comparison-values/)

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

Cloudflare Rules expressions now support dynamic values on both sides of equality and ordering comparisons. You can compare request fields or function results with one another.

For example, compare the current request path with its original value:
    
    
    http.request.uri.path ne raw.http.request.uri.path

For supported operators and examples, refer to [Compare dynamic values](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/operators/#compare-dynamic-values).

Oct 1, 2026

## [WAF Release - 2026-10-01 - Emergency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-10-01-emergency-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This update provides immediate defense against a vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway appliances, deploying protection against improper input validation vectors.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-88771: An improper input validation vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands.



**Impact**

We strongly recommend that administrators apply the latest versions to fully secure origin servers. Additionally, customers should review configurations against applicable preconditions and follow standard incident response processes if signs of compromise are identified.

## [Longer rule descriptions in logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-30-longer-rule-descriptions-in-logs/)

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

Cloudflare logs now include up to 128 bytes of a rule description, increased from 80 bytes. Longer descriptions provide more context when investigating matched rules and make it easier to identify the relevant rule without referring back to its configuration.

Descriptions longer than 128 bytes are truncated without splitting a UTF-8 character. This change does not affect the Rulesets API, which continues to accept rule descriptions of up to 4,096 bytes.

For more information, refer to [Rule object structure and properties](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rulesets-api/json-object/#rule-object-structure-and-properties).

## [Identify Mesh, Workers VPC, and Cloudflare Tunnel replicas in network logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-29-mesh-workers-vpc-network-logs/)

[Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/)[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/)[Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/)[Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-controls/)[Workers VPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/)

You can now tell a person on a laptop apart from a Mesh node or an AI agent running on Workers, without matching on connector email addresses or Mesh IP ranges — and see exactly which Cloudflare Tunnel and `cloudflared` replica received each session.

[Gateway network logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/dashboard-logs/gateway-logs/#network-logs) and [Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/) now identify two new kinds of traffic:

  * **Mesh** — Traffic sent from or delivered to a [Cloudflare Mesh](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mesh/) node. Previously, Mesh nodes were logged the same way as devices running the [Cloudflare One Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/), because Mesh nodes run the client in headless mode.
  * **Workers VPC** — Traffic sent by a Worker through a [Workers VPC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-vpc/) binding. Previously, Workers VPC sessions were not recorded in Network Session Logs.

![Viewing Mesh and Workers VPC traffic in Gateway network logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/image/onerror=redirect,width=1439,height=796,format=webp/_astro/2026-09-28-mesh-workers-vpc-network-logs.iGvLKYk7.gif)

#### Gateway network logs

To view these values in the dashboard, go to **Zero Trust** > **Insights & Logs** > **Logs** > **Network logs** , select **Columns** , and turn on **Traffic Source** and **Traffic Destination**. Both values also appear under **Network query details** when you open a log entry.

#### Network Session Logs

The `zero_trust_network_sessions` dataset, available through [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/logs/logpush/), includes the following fields:

Field | Description  
---|---  
`OnrampType` | How the session entered Cloudflare One. Values: `CF1_CLIENT`, `MESH`, `WORKERS_VPC`, `MAGIC`, `OTHER`.  
`Offramp` | Where the session was routed. Sessions routed to a Mesh node report `MESH`.  
`SourceName` | Name of the Worker that started the session. Only populated for Workers VPC sessions.  
`SourceID` | Stable identifier of the Worker that started the session. Only populated for Workers VPC sessions.  
`DestinationReplicaID` | The replica that served the session, such as a specific replica of a Mesh node or a `cloudflared` replica of a Cloudflare Tunnel.  
  
For example, `OnrampType = 'WORKERS_VPC' AND Offramp = 'MESH'` returns every session where a Worker reached a service behind a Mesh node, and `SourceName` tells you which Worker it was.

Redeploy your Workers

`SourceName` and `SourceID` are only populated for Workers deployed after 29 September 2026. To include them for an existing Worker, redeploy it — for example, with `npx wrangler deploy`. No code changes are required.

#### See which tunnel and replica received a session

With `DestinationReplicaID`, you can now confirm which [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/) and which `cloudflared` replica received traffic for a specific session. Combine it with the existing `DestinationTunnelID` field to trace a session to an exact tunnel replica — or Mesh node replica — when you run multiple replicas for high availability. The replica ID matches the **Connector ID** shown in the dashboard, so you can [stream that replica's logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/observability/#remote-log-streaming) with `cloudflared tail --connector-id`.

Sessions logged before this change are not backfilled. For all available fields, refer to [Zero Trust Network Session Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/).

## [WAF Release - 2026-09-25 - Emergency](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-25-emergency-waf-release/)

[WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/)

This update provides immediate defense against critical vulnerabilities affecting WordPress and JFrog Artifactory, including path traversal, local file inclusion (LFI), cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication bypass exploits.

**Key Findings**

  * CVE-2026-87902: A high-severity Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability affecting WordPress. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this flaw to read arbitrary files on the host server, potentially exposing sensitive configuration data or system files.

  * CVE-2026-42018 & CVE-2026-82329: Critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities affecting JFrog Artifactory. Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security controls and achieve unauthorized access to the Artifactory instance.




**Impact**

We strongly recommend that administrators apply the latest vendor patches for WordPress and JFrog Artifactory to fully secure origin servers.

The `concat()` function in Cloudflare Rules now accepts up to 32 arguments, increased from 16. This allows you to build richer dynamic values directly in Rules expressions and simplify configurations that combine request data.

A common use case is adding a request header that sends context to your origin. The following Rulesets API request adds a Request Header Transform Rule to an existing `http_request_late_transform` phase ruleset. Its 18-argument expression combines request and network information into one header value:
    
    
    curl --request POST \
      "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "ref": "add_request_context_header",
        "description": "Add request context for the origin",
        "expression": "true",
        "action": "rewrite",
        "action_parameters": {
          "headers": {
            "X-Request-Context": {
              "operation": "set",
              "expression": "concat(\"ip=\", to_string(ip.src), \";country=\", ip.src.country, \";host=\", http.host, \";method=\", http.request.method, \";path=\", http.request.uri.path, \";query=\", http.request.uri.query, \";ray-id=\", cf.ray_id, \";asn=\", to_string(ip.src.asnum), \";user-agent=\", http.user_agent)"
            }
          }
        }
      }'

## [cloudflared to deprecate 32-bit Windows and Intel-based macOS builds in 2027](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-18-cloudflared-architecture-deprecation/)

[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/)[Cloudflare Tunnel for SASE](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/)

Starting in 2027, Cloudflare will deprecate 32-bit Windows and Intel-based macOS builds of `cloudflared`. After the deprecation takes effect, Cloudflare will no longer publish new `cloudflared` releases for either architecture.

Windows 10, the last Windows release to support 32-bit systems, reached end of support in October 2025. Apple has also deprecated Intel-based Mac computers. macOS 26 Tahoe, released in September 2025, was the final macOS release to support Intel-based Macs. macOS 27, released in September 2026, no longer supports them.

Focusing development on currently supported architectures allows `cloudflared` to align with operating system support and continue receiving updates on supported platforms. For available downloads and supported platforms, refer to the [Cloudflare Tunnel downloads](https://developers.cloudflare.com/tunnel/downloads/) documentation.

## [Validate Rulesets changes before deployment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-17-rulesets-dry-run-validation/)

[Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/)

Cloudflare Rules now validates ruleset changes before deployment, helping you catch invalid expressions, action parameters, permission issues, unavailable features, and quota limits without publishing the configuration.

The Cloudflare dashboard performs this validation automatically when you create or update rules from **Security** > **Security rules** or **Rules** > **Overview**.

Supported Rulesets API mutation endpoints now also accept the `dry_run=true` query parameter. A dry run performs the same authorization and server-side validation checks as the requested change, but does not persist or publish it. Successful operations that normally return a `200` response return `result: null`. Operations that normally return `204` continue to do so.

#### API example

Add `dry_run=true` to a Rulesets API request to validate it without creating the ruleset:
    
    
    curl --request POST \
      "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets?dry_run=true" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "name": "Custom firewall rules",
        "kind": "zone",
        "phase": "http_request_firewall_custom",
        "rules": [
          {
            "action": "block",
            "expression": "ip.src.country eq \"GB\"",
            "description": "Block requests from the United Kingdom",
            "enabled": true
          }
        ]
      }'

## [Control JavaScript Detections API results](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-16-jsd-api-results/)

[Bots](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/)

Enterprise Bot Management customers can control whether Cloudflare uses results created through the JavaScript Detections API for bot scoring and detections.

Turn **JavaScript Detections for API traffic** on or off in **Security** > **Settings**. You can also configure the zone through the Bot Management API by setting `jsd_api_results_enabled`:
    
    
    {
    	"jsd_api_results_enabled": true
    }

This setting is separate from zone-wide script injection. When it is off, the API script can still execute and return `success` to the callback, but Cloudflare does not consume the result.

For more information, refer to [JavaScript Detections](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-challenges/challenge-types/javascript-detections/#api).
