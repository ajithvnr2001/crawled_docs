AI Gateway is available to use on all plans.

AI Gateway's core features available today are offered for free, and all it takes is a Cloudflare account and one line of code to [get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/get-started/). Core features include: dashboard analytics, caching, and rate limiting.

You can monitor your usage in the AI Gateway dashboard.

## Logs

AI Gateway stores logs in either Workers Logs or Legacy Logs, depending on when your account created its first gateway.

### Workers Logs

Accounts that created their first gateway on or after September 24, 2026 store logs in Workers Logs and follow [Workers Logs pricing and retention](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs/#pricing).

### Legacy Logs

Accounts that created a gateway before September 24, 2026 use [Legacy Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/legacy-logs/). Persistent log storage is available on all plans with these limits:

Plan | Log storage limit  
---|---  
Workers Free | 100,000 logs total across all gateways  
Workers Paid | 10,000,000 logs per gateway  
  
For storage behavior and deletion options, refer to [Legacy Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/legacy-logs/#manage-storage).

## Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

DLP scanning in AI Gateway is free on all plans. Accounts without a Zero Trust subscription have access to two predefined [DLP profiles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/dlp-profiles/): Financial Information and Social / Insurance / National Identifier Numbers.

DLP profiles are shared at the account level with [Cloudflare One](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/data-loss-prevention/). If your account has a Zero Trust subscription that includes DLP, the full set of profiles — including all predefined profiles, custom profiles, integration profiles, DLP datasets, and OCR — is automatically available in AI Gateway.

## Guardrails

[Guardrails](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/guardrails/) evaluates prompts and responses using [`@cf/meta/llama-guard-3-8b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/) on Workers AI. Usage is billed as [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing/) token-based inference — cost scales with the length of the prompts and responses being evaluated.

## Unified Billing

A 5% fee is applied to all credits purchased through [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/). For example, a $100 credit purchase will result in a $105 charge. Inference pricing from providers is passed through with no markup — you pay the same per-token rates as you would directly with the provider.

## Logpush

[Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/logging/logpush/) is available to all AI Gateway customers. Exports of AI Gateway logs are billed according to [Logpush pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/pricing/), based on the volume of logs exported and transformed.

## Pricing notes

Prices subject to change. If you are an Enterprise customer, reach out to your account team to confirm pricing details.
