OverviewWhen to use TraceResources

Available on all plans

Cloudflare Trace (Beta) simulates an HTTP/S request through Cloudflare's network to your origin server. Use this tool to understand how your Cloudflare configurations (such as rules, caching, and security settings) would affect a specific request. If the hostname you are testing is not [proxied by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/), Cloudflare Trace will still return all the configurations that Cloudflare would have applied to the request.

You can define specific request properties to simulate different conditions for an HTTP/S request. Rules that are turned off in Cloudflare products will not be evaluated.

Cloudflare Trace is available to users with an Administrator or Super Administrator role.

## When to use Trace

Use Trace when you need to test what would happen with a simulated request:

  * Understanding why a rule did not trigger as expected
  * Testing how your rules handle different request scenarios
  * Seeing the evaluation order of your rules
  * Simulating requests from different geolocations or conditions
  * Confirming that WAF, cache, and firewall rules will not block or modify a specific path before you turn on a new feature — for example, checking that WAF custom rules or rate limiting rules will not intercept your [Google tag gateway for advertisers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/google-tag-gateway/) measurement path



Use [Log Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/observability/logs/log-explorer/) when you need to investigate what actually happened with real production traffic:

  * Analyzing historical data and trends
  * Investigating security incidents after they occur
  * Searching for patterns across thousands of requests
  * Monitoring application performance over time
  * Providing forensic evidence to support teams



The key difference is that Trace simulates "what-if" scenarios, while Log Explorer shows actual historical traffic.
