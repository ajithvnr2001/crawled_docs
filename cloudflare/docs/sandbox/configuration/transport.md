Note

This page documents Sandbox SDK 0.x for existing applications. For new applications, refer to [Sandboxes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/). To move an existing application to `@cloudflare/sandbox` 1.0, refer to [Migrate from Sandbox SDK 0.x](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/migrate/).

Configure how the Sandbox SDK communicates with containers using transport modes.

## Overview

The Sandbox SDK supports three transport modes for communication between the Durable Object and the container:

  * **HTTP transport** (default) - Each SDK operation makes a separate HTTP request to the container.
  * **NEW: RPC transport** \- All SDK operations are multiplexed over a single persistent WebSocket connection. Will replace HTTP as the default transport in future. Available since 0.9.1.
  * **Deprecated: WebSocket transport** \- All SDK operations are multiplexed over a single persistent WebSocket. Superseded by RPC transport which uses an improved protocol.



## When to use RPC transport

Use the RPC transport when your Worker or Durable Object makes many SDK operations per request. This avoids hitting [subrequest limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#subrequests).

### Subrequest limits

Cloudflare Workers have subrequest limits that apply when making requests to external services, including container API calls:

  * **Workers Free** : 50 subrequests per request
  * **Workers Paid** : 1,000 subrequests per request



With HTTP transport (default), each SDK operation (`exec()`, `readFile()`, `writeFile()`, etc.) consumes one subrequest. Applications that perform many sandbox operations in a single request can hit these limits.

### How RPC transport helps

RPC transport establishes a single persistent connection to the container and multiplexes all SDK operations over it. The WebSocket upgrade counts as **one subrequest** regardless of how many operations you perform afterwards.

**Example with HTTP transport (4 subrequests):**
    
    
    await sandbox.exec("python setup.py");
    await sandbox.writeFile("/app/config.json", config);
    await sandbox.exec("python process.py");
    const result = await sandbox.readFile("/app/output.txt");

**Same code with RPC transport (1 subrequest):**
    
    
    // Identical code - transport is configured via environment variable
    await sandbox.exec("python setup.py");
    await sandbox.writeFile("/app/config.json", config);
    await sandbox.exec("python process.py");
    const result = await sandbox.readFile("/app/output.txt");

RPC transport also removes the [32 MiB limitation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/rpc/#limitations) that the HTTP transport has. Pass a `ReadableStream` instance to the `writeFile()` method.
    
    
    const req = await fetch("https://example.com/archive.tar.gz");
    await sandbox.writeFile("/archive.tar.gz", req.body);

## Configuration

Set the `SANDBOX_TRANSPORT` environment variable in your Worker's configuration. The SDK reads this from the Worker environment bindings (not from inside the container).

### HTTP transport (default)

HTTP transport is the default and requires no additional configuration.

### RPC transport

Enable RPC transport by adding `SANDBOX_TRANSPORT` to your Worker's `vars`:
    
    
    {
    	"name": "my-sandbox-worker",
    	"main": "src/index.ts",
    	// Set this to today's date
    	"compatibility_date": "2026-10-08",
    	"vars": {
    		"SANDBOX_TRANSPORT": "rpc"
    	},
    	"containers": [
    		{
    			"class_name": "Sandbox",
    			"image": "./Dockerfile",
    		},
    	],
    	"durable_objects": {
    		"bindings": [
    			{
    				"class_name": "Sandbox",
    				"name": "Sandbox",
    			},
    		],
    	},
    }
    
    
    name = "my-sandbox-worker"
    main = "src/index.ts"
    # Set this to today's date
    compatibility_date = "2026-10-08"
    
    [vars]
    SANDBOX_TRANSPORT = "rpc"
    
    [[containers]]
    class_name = "Sandbox"
    image = "./Dockerfile"
    
    [[durable_objects.bindings]]
    class_name = "Sandbox"
    name = "Sandbox"

No application code changes are needed. The SDK automatically uses the configured transport for all operations.

## Transport behavior

### Connection lifecycle

**HTTP transport:**

  * Creates a new HTTP request for each SDK operation
  * No persistent connection
  * Each request is independent and stateless



**RPC transport:**

  * Establishes a WebSocket connection on the first SDK operation
  * Maintains the persistent connection for all subsequent operations
  * Connection is closed when the sandbox sleeps or is evicted
  * Automatically reconnects if the connection drops



### Streaming support

All transports support streaming operations (like `exec()` with real-time output):

  * **HTTP transport** \- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE)
  * **RPC transport** \- Uses WebSocket streaming messages



Your code remains identical regardless of transport mode.

### Error handling

All transports provide identical error handling behavior. The SDK automatically retries on transient errors (like 503 responses) with exponential backoff.

WebSocket-specific behavior:

  * Connection failures trigger automatic reconnection
  * The SDK transparently handles WebSocket disconnections
  * In-flight operations are not lost during reconnection



## Choosing a transport

We expect the RPC transport to replace the default HTTP transport in a future release. New functionality may support only the RPC transport. Switching to use it now will avoid migrations in the future.

## Migration guide

Switching between transports requires no code changes.

### Switch from HTTP to RPC

Requires staged deployment

Using the `rpc` transport requires version 0.9.1 or newer. If you are using an older version of the Sandbox SDK upgrade and deploy your application with the newer `@cloudflare/sandbox` and image first. Otherwise there will be issues with newer SDK clients attempting to connect to older sandboxes that do not support the new transport.

Add `SANDBOX_TRANSPORT` to your `wrangler.jsonc`:
    
    
    {
    	"vars": {
    		"SANDBOX_TRANSPORT": "rpc"
    	},
    }
    
    
    [vars]
    SANDBOX_TRANSPORT = "rpc"

Then deploy:
    
    
    npx wrangler deploy

### Switch from RPC to HTTP

Remove the `SANDBOX_TRANSPORT` variable (or set it to `"http"`):
    
    
    {
    	"vars": {
    		// Remove SANDBOX_TRANSPORT or set to "http"
    	},
    }
    
    
    vars = { }

### Switch from deprecated WebSocket to RPC

Requires staged deployment

Using the `rpc` transport requires version 0.9.1 or newer. If you are using an older version of the Sandbox SDK upgrade and deploy your application with the newer `@cloudflare/sandbox` and image first. Otherwise there will be issues with newer SDK clients attempting to connect to older sandboxes that do not support the new transport.

Set the `SANDBOX_TRANSPORT` variable to `"rpc"`:
    
    
    {
    	"vars": {
    		"SANDBOX_TRANSPORT": "rpc"
    	},
    }
    
    
    [vars]
    SANDBOX_TRANSPORT = "rpc"
