Note

This page documents Sandbox SDK 0.x for existing applications. For new applications, refer to [Serve previews on their own hostnames](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/previews/serve-previews-on-their-own-hostnames/). To move an existing application to `@cloudflare/sandbox` 1.0, refer to [Migrate from Sandbox SDK 0.x](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/migrate/).

Set up wildcard DNS, routes, and TLS so `exposePort()` preview URLs work on your domain. To deploy the Worker and sandbox image, refer to [Deploy a Sandbox application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/guides/deploy/).

Only required for preview URLs

Custom domain setup is only needed if you use `exposePort()` to expose services from sandboxes. If your application does not use `exposePort()`, you can deploy to `.workers.dev` without this configuration.

For public URLs without custom-domain setup, [`sandbox.tunnels`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/api/tunnels/) is an alternative: quick tunnels for development, named tunnels for stable hostnames in production.

Preview URLs need wildcard DNS because each exposed port gets a unique subdomain: `https://8080-abc123.yourdomain.com`.

The `.workers.dev` domain does not support wildcard subdomains, so preview URLs that must be reachable on a public hostname outside local development need a custom domain.

Subdomain depth matters for TLS

If your Worker runs on a subdomain (for example, `sandbox.yourdomain.com`), preview URLs become second-level wildcards like `*.sandbox.yourdomain.com`. Cloudflare's Universal SSL only covers first-level wildcards (`*.yourdomain.com`), so you need a certificate covering `*.sandbox.yourdomain.com`. Without it, preview URLs will fail with TLS handshake errors.

You have three options:

  * **Run the Worker on the apex domain** (`yourdomain.com`) so preview URLs stay at the first level (`*.yourdomain.com`), which Universal SSL covers automatically. This is the simplest option.
  * **Use[Advanced Certificate Manager](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/)** ($10/month) to provision a certificate for `*.sandbox.yourdomain.com` through the Cloudflare dashboard.
  * **Upload a custom certificate** from a provider like [Let's Encrypt ↗︎](https://letsencrypt.org/) (free). Generate a wildcard certificate for `*.sandbox.yourdomain.com` using the DNS-01 challenge, then upload it via the Cloudflare dashboard under **SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates > [Custom Certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/)**. You will need to renew it before expiry.



## Prerequisites

  * Active Cloudflare zone with a domain
  * Worker that uses `exposePort()`
  * [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed
  * Sandbox app already [deployable](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/guides/deploy/) (Worker + image)



## Setup

### Create a wildcard DNS record

In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain and create an A record:

  * **Type** : A
  * **Name** : `*` (wildcard)
  * **IPv4 address** : `192.0.2.0`
  * **Proxy status** : Proxied (orange cloud)



This routes all subdomains through Cloudflare's proxy. The IP address `192.0.2.0` is a documentation address (RFC 5737) that Cloudflare recognizes when proxied.

### Configure Worker routes

Add a wildcard route to your Wrangler configuration:
    
    
    {
    	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    	"name": "my-sandbox-app",
    	"main": "src/index.ts",
    	"upload_source_maps": true,
    	// Set this to today's date
    	"compatibility_date": "2026-10-13",
    	"routes": [
    		{
    			"pattern": "*.yourdomain.com/*",
    			"zone_name": "yourdomain.com"
    		}
    	]
    }
    
    
    "$schema" = "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json"
    name = "my-sandbox-app"
    main = "src/index.ts"
    upload_source_maps = true
    # Set this to today's date
    compatibility_date = "2026-10-13"
    
    [[routes]]
    pattern = "*.yourdomain.com/*"
    zone_name = "yourdomain.com"

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. This routes all subdomain requests to your Worker and enables Cloudflare to provision SSL certificates automatically.

### Apply the route

Redeploy the Worker so the route configuration takes effect:
    
    
    npx wrangler deploy

If this deploy also changes your sandbox image or package, follow [Deploy a Sandbox application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/sdk/guides/deploy/) for rollout and package/image pairing. For route-only changes you can still use a normal deploy. Use `--containers-rollout=none` only when you intentionally skip container image and instance updates.

## Verify

Test that preview URLs work:
    
    
    // Extract hostname from request
    const { hostname } = new URL(request.url);
    
    const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, "test-sandbox");
    await sandbox.startProcess("python -m http.server 8080");
    const exposed = await sandbox.exposePort(8080, { hostname });
    
    console.log(exposed.url);
    // https://8080-test-sandbox.yourdomain.com

Visit the URL in your browser to confirm your service is accessible.

## Troubleshooting

  * **CustomDomainRequiredError** : Verify your Worker is not deployed only to `.workers.dev` and that the wildcard DNS record and route are configured correctly.
  * **SSL/TLS errors** : Wait a few minutes for certificate provisioning. Verify the DNS record is proxied and SSL/TLS mode is set to "Full" or "Full (strict)" in your dashboard. If your Worker is on a subdomain (for example, `sandbox.yourdomain.com`), Universal SSL will not cover the second-level wildcard `*.sandbox.yourdomain.com`. Refer to the TLS caution at the top of this page for options.
  * **Preview URL not resolving** : Confirm the wildcard DNS record exists and is proxied. Wait 30–60 seconds for DNS propagation.
  * **Port not accessible** : Ensure your service binds to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost`) and that `proxyToSandbox()` is called first in your Worker's fetch handler.
