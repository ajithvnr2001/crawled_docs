# About

Last updated Oct 12, 2026|Copy as Markdown|[View as Markdown](https://developers.cloudflare.com/index.md)|[Agent setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agent-setup/)

Magic Transit is a network security and performance solution that offers Distributed Denial of Service ([DDoS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/)) protection, traffic acceleration, and more for on-premise, cloud-hosted, and hybrid networks.

Magic Transit delivers its connectivity, security, and performance benefits by serving as the front door to your IP network. This means it accepts IP packets destined for your network, processes them, and then outputs them to your origin infrastructure.

The Cloudflare network uses [Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) ↗︎](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/) to announce your company's IP address space, extending your network presence globally, and [anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) to ingest your traffic. Today, Cloudflare's anycast global network spans [hundreds of cities worldwide ↗︎](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/).

Once [packets ↗︎](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) hit Cloudflare's network, Cloudflare inspects traffic for attacks, filters, steers, accelerates, and sends it to your origin. Magic Transit connects to your origin infrastructure using anycast Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels over the Internet or, with [Cloudflare Network Interconnect (CNI)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/network-interconnect/), through physical or virtual interconnect.

You have two options for your Magic Transit implementation: ingress traffic or ingress and [egress traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/reference/egress/). With an egress implementation, you must set up policy-based routing (PBR) or ensure default routing on your end forwards traffic to Cloudflare through tunnels.
