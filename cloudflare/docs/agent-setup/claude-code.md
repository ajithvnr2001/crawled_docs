[Cloudflare Skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)·[Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)·[Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)·[Claude Code Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

## Quick start

  1. **Install Claude Code**

Install the Claude Code CLI. For Windows, Homebrew, WinGet, or npm, see the [Claude Code setup guide ↗︎](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup).
         
         curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

  2. **Launch Claude Code in your project**

Start Claude Code from the root of your project, where `wrangler.jsonc` or `cloudflare.config.ts` lives (if either exists).
         
         claude

  3. **Install the Cloudflare plugin**

In Claude Code, run these two slash commands. This installs Cloudflare Skills and registers the Cloudflare MCP servers.
         
         /plugin marketplace add cloudflare/skills
         /plugin install cloudflare@cloudflare

  4. **Try a prompt**

For example:
         
         Add real-time collaboration to my app using Durable Objects with WebSocket hibernation.




## Cloudflare platform access

Expand any section to learn more.

Cloudflare Skills

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

  * agents-sdkBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Agents SDK applications using the agents package.
  * basinBuild and troubleshoot Cloudflare Basin analytics workflows with Basin Pipelines, Basin Catalog, and Basin SQL. Use for streaming data into R2 Iceberg tables, managing catalogs, or querying those tables; also use for requests using the former Data Platform, Pipelines, R2 Data Catalog, or R2 SQL names.
  * cf-cliCloudflare's official cf CLI (beta) for the public Cloudflare API and Workers projects. Use for finding and running Cloudflare commands from the terminal — sign-in and profiles, cf cli search, cf schema, cf deploy/dev/build, resource commands for DNS, zones, D1, KV, and R2 — and for choosing between cf and Wrangler in a project.
  * cloudflareDiscover and choose Cloudflare products for apps, APIs, AI agents, storage, networking, and security. Use for architecture and product selection, including when the user describes a need without naming a Cloudflare product; then find the relevant skill or documentation.
  * cloudflare-email-serviceImplement or troubleshoot Cloudflare Email Sending and Email Routing integrations and their delivery configuration.
  * cloudflare-oneDesign, configure, troubleshoot, or review Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE deployments. Use cloudflare-one-migrations for migration planning from other vendors.
  * cloudflare-one-migrationsAssess and plan migrations from existing VPN, SWG, or SASE platforms to Cloudflare One, including policy mapping, parity gaps, and rollout.
  * durable-objectsBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Durable Objects code for persistent state and coordination.
  * k2Build and troubleshoot Cloudflare K2 or K2 Streams durable logs. Use for stream setup, producing from Workers or HTTP, configuring retention and inputs, and consuming through subscriptions.
  * nextjs-on-cloudflareBuild, migrate, and deploy Next.js apps on Cloudflare Workers with vinext. Use when starting a Next.js project on Cloudflare, moving an existing app to Workers, choosing between vinext and OpenNext, or setting up vinext for Workers. For setup, migration, or deployment, install vinext's upstream skills with `npx skills add cloudflare/vinext` if missing, then read and follow the applicable skill and docs.
  * sandbox-migrate-to-nextMigrate Cloudflare Sandbox apps from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-next for apps already on the preview.
  * sandbox-nextBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-migrate-to-next when porting a stable app.
  * sandbox-stableBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the stable @cloudflare/sandbox package. Use sandbox-next for preview apps and sandbox-migrate-to-next for stable-to-preview migrations.
  * turnstile-spinSet up, repair, or migrate to Cloudflare Turnstile bot verification in an existing frontend and backend, including server-side Siteverify.
  * web-perfAudit, diagnose, or optimize website loading and interaction performance, Core Web Vitals, and Lighthouse performance scores.
  * workers-best-practicesCloudflare Workers best practices for production applications. Use when writing, reviewing, or configuring Workers.
  * workers-profilingProfile or debug CPU usage and memory allocation in deployed Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects. Then use this information to optimize your code.
  * wranglerRun or troubleshoot Wrangler CLI commands in projects that have a wrangler.jsonc, wrangler.json, or wrangler.toml file, including local development, Previews, deployment, and resource management. For new projects and projects without a Wrangler configuration file, use the cf CLI instead.



MCP servers

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: [Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/) — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in ~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) repo. The full catalog is also in the [MCP servers for Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/) docs.

Wrangler CLI

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like `wrangler d1 migrations apply` or `wrangler tail`. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

Cloudflare CLI (beta)

The [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`, covers the public Cloudflare API and prints JSON output. Install it with `npm install -g cf`, then follow [Use cf with AI agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/agents/).

Agent-friendly docs

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append `/index.md` to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own `llms.txt` — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

  * [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) — directory of every Cloudflare product.
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt)
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt)
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt)
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt)



For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the [Docs for Agents guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/).

## Example prompts
    
    
    Set up WAF rules to block SQL injection and XSS attacks on my application.
    
    
    Build an image upload and transformation service using R2 and Cloudflare Images.
    
    
    Set up a Waiting Room to handle flash sale traffic spikes without dropping requests.
    
    
    Optimize my Worker to serve WebP images with responsive resizing using Cloudflare Images.
    
    
    Deploy a full-stack React app to Cloudflare Pages with a Workers API backend and D1 database.

## Tips

  * The Skills plugin includes a wrangler Skill — Claude knows when to reach for `npx wrangler deploy`, `wrangler d1 migrations apply`, and other CLI commands automatically.
  * The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — Claude writes JavaScript against a TypeScript API to hit any of 2,500+ endpoints in ~1,000 tokens.
  * Claude Code works best from the root of your Workers project where `wrangler.jsonc` or `cloudflare.config.ts` lives — this is what the agent uses to understand your bindings.
  * Use `claude mcp list` to verify Cloudflare servers are connected. For CI/CD, skip OAuth by passing a Cloudflare API token as a bearer token instead.



### [Cloudflare MCP server repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)

Installing additional MCP servers, and when to use Code Mode versus traditional MCP servers.

## FAQ

Should I use Skills, the MCP server, a CLI, or all of them?

All three — and the Skills plugin configures them together. Skills give Claude persistent Cloudflare knowledge (when to use Durable Objects vs KV, what a good Workers project layout looks like). The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, R2 buckets, Zero Trust). Wrangler runs local dev and Workers-specific commands. The `wrangler` Skill teaches Claude when to reach for which. For tasks across the whole Cloudflare API, Claude can also use the [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`.

Can Claude Code use the Cloudflare CLI?

Yes. The [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`, is in beta and covers the whole Cloudflare API and prints JSON output. Install it with `npm install -g cf`, sign in with `cf auth login`, and tell Claude Code to prefer it in `CLAUDE.md`. Refer to [Use cf with AI agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/agents/).

How do I give Claude Code access to my Cloudflare account?

The first time Claude calls a Cloudflare tool, you will be redirected to authorize via OAuth and choose what permissions to grant.

Can Claude Code deploy to existing Workers projects?

Yes. Run Claude Code from your existing project directory where `wrangler.jsonc` or `cloudflare.config.ts` is located, and it will understand your project configuration and deploy accordingly.

What does Code Mode mean for MCP?

Code Mode is how the Cloudflare API MCP server fits all 2,500+ API endpoints into ~1,000 tokens. Instead of exposing every endpoint as a separate tool, it exposes two — `search()` and `execute()` — and Claude writes JavaScript to call them. [Learn more about Code Mode ↗︎](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/).

## Troubleshooting

MCP server connection fails or times out

Run `claude mcp list` to verify the server is registered. Try removing and re-adding: `claude mcp remove cloudflare` then re-add it. Ensure you have `npx` and `mcp-remote` available.

Claude cannot authenticate with Cloudflare

The MCP server uses OAuth. When prompted, complete the authorization flow in your browser. For CI/CD, create a Cloudflare API token and pass it as a bearer token instead.

Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

Point the agent directly at [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) for a directory of every product, or `developers.cloudflare.com/<product>/llms.txt` for a product-specific index.
