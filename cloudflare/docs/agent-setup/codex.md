[Cloudflare Skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills)·[Cloudflare Code Mode API MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp)·[Cloudflare Domain Specific MCPs](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)·[Codex Docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/)

## Quick start

  1. **Install Codex**

Install the Codex CLI. macOS and Linux are fully supported; use WSL2 on Windows. For Homebrew or other install methods, see the [Codex CLI setup guide ↗︎](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/).
         
         npm install -g @openai/codex

  2. **Launch Codex in your project**

Start Codex from the root of your project, where `wrangler.jsonc` or `cloudflare.config.ts` lives (if either exists).
         
         codex

  3. **Install the Cloudflare plugin**

Inside Codex, run `/plugins`, then search for and install **Cloudflare**. This installs Cloudflare Skills and registers the Cloudflare MCP servers.
         
         /plugins

  4. **Try a prompt**

For example:
         
         Use Workers for Platforms to let my customers deploy their own code in isolated environments.




  1. **Download Codex**

Follow the download instructions for your operating system at [developers.openai.com/codex/app ↗︎](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app).

  2. **Install the Cloudflare plugin**

In the Codex app, go to **Plugins** and install **Cloudflare**.

## Cloudflare platform access

Expand any section to learn more.

Cloudflare Skills

Persistent platform context that teaches the agent how Cloudflare works.

Skills are instructions the agent loads on demand. The [cloudflare/skills](https://github.com/cloudflare/skills) bundle covers every layer of the platform — so the agent knows your conventions without you re-explaining them.

  * agents-sdkBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Agents SDK applications using the agents package.
  * basinBuild and troubleshoot Cloudflare Basin analytics workflows with Basin Pipelines, Basin Catalog, and Basin SQL. Use for streaming data into R2 Iceberg tables, managing catalogs, or querying those tables; also use for requests using the former Data Platform, Pipelines, R2 Data Catalog, or R2 SQL names.
  * cf-cliCloudflare's official cf CLI (beta) for the public Cloudflare API and Workers projects. Use for finding and running Cloudflare commands from the terminal — sign-in and profiles, cf cli search, cf schema, cf deploy/dev/build, resource commands for DNS, zones, D1, KV, and R2 — and for choosing between cf and Wrangler in a project.
  * cloudflareDiscover and choose Cloudflare products for apps, APIs, AI agents, storage, networking, and security. Use for architecture and product selection, including when the user describes a need without naming a Cloudflare product; then find the relevant skill or documentation.
  * cloudflare-email-serviceImplement or troubleshoot Cloudflare Email Sending and Email Routing integrations and their delivery configuration.
  * cloudflare-oneDesign, configure, troubleshoot, or review Cloudflare One Zero Trust and SASE deployments. Use cloudflare-one-migrations for migration planning from other vendors.
  * cloudflare-one-migrationsAssess and plan migrations from existing VPN, SWG, or SASE platforms to Cloudflare One, including policy mapping, parity gaps, and rollout.
  * durable-objectsBuild, debug, or review Cloudflare Durable Objects code for persistent state and coordination.
  * k2Build and troubleshoot Cloudflare K2 or K2 Streams durable logs. Use for stream setup, producing from Workers or HTTP, configuring retention and inputs, and consuming through subscriptions.
  * nextjs-on-cloudflareBuild, migrate, and deploy Next.js apps on Cloudflare Workers with vinext. Use when starting a Next.js project on Cloudflare, moving an existing app to Workers, choosing between vinext and OpenNext, or setting up vinext for Workers. For setup, migration, or deployment, install vinext's upstream skills with `npx skills add cloudflare/vinext` if missing, then read and follow the applicable skill and docs.
  * sandbox-migrate-to-nextMigrate Cloudflare Sandbox apps from stable @cloudflare/sandbox to @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-next for apps already on the preview.
  * sandbox-nextBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on @cloudflare/sandbox@next (SDK 1.0 preview). Use sandbox-migrate-to-next when porting a stable app.
  * sandbox-stableBuild or maintain Cloudflare Sandbox apps on the stable @cloudflare/sandbox package. Use sandbox-next for preview apps and sandbox-migrate-to-next for stable-to-preview migrations.
  * turnstile-spinSet up, repair, or migrate to Cloudflare Turnstile bot verification in an existing frontend and backend, including server-side Siteverify.
  * web-perfAudit, diagnose, or optimize website loading and interaction performance, Core Web Vitals, and Lighthouse performance scores.
  * workers-best-practicesCloudflare Workers best practices for production applications. Use when writing, reviewing, or configuring Workers.
  * workers-profilingProfile or debug CPU usage and memory allocation in deployed Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects. Then use this information to optimize your code.
  * wranglerRun or troubleshoot Wrangler CLI commands in projects that have a wrangler.jsonc, wrangler.json, or wrangler.toml file, including local development, Previews, deployment, and resource management. For new projects and projects without a Wrangler configuration file, use the cf CLI instead.



MCP servers

Live access to the Cloudflare API, docs, and observability.

MCP servers provide typed tools to call into Cloudflare at runtime. There are two options: [Code Mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode-mcp/) — a single server that covers the entire Cloudflare API (2,500+ endpoints in ~1,000 tokens) — or a set of focused, domain-specific servers hosted in the [cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare) repo. The full catalog is also in the [MCP servers for Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/cloudflare/servers-for-cloudflare/) docs.

Wrangler CLI

Local dev, deploys, and Workers-specific commands.

Use [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) for local development, deploys, and product-specific commands like `wrangler d1 migrations apply` or `wrangler tail`. The bundled **wrangler** Skill teaches the agent when to reach for it.

Cloudflare CLI (beta)

The [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`, covers the public Cloudflare API and prints JSON output. Install it with `npm install -g cf`, then follow [Use cf with AI agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/agents/).

Agent-friendly docs

Token-efficient references optimized for agents.

Append `/index.md` to any Cloudflare docs URL for a clean markdown version. Every top-level product section also has its own `llms.txt` — a page index sized for a single context window. A few useful ones:

  * [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) — directory of every Cloudflare product.
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/llms.txt)
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/llms.txt)
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/llms.txt)
  * [developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/llms.txt)



For a full overview of how these docs are structured for agents, refer to the [Docs for Agents guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-for-agents/).

## Example prompts
    
    
    Use Workers for Platforms to let my customers deploy their own code in isolated environments.
    
    
    Set up GitHub Actions to deploy this Worker to staging and production on Cloudflare.
    
    
    Deploy a full-stack React app to Cloudflare Pages with a Workers API backend and D1 database.
    
    
    Build a serverless AI inference endpoint on Workers AI with streaming responses.
    
    
    Configure Zero Trust access policies to protect my internal staging environment.

## Tips

  * The Cloudflare API MCP server uses Code Mode — Codex writes JavaScript against a typed API to reach any of 2,500+ endpoints in ~1,000 tokens.



### [Cloudflare MCP server repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare)

Installing additional MCP servers, and when to use Code Mode versus traditional MCP servers.

## FAQ

Should I use Skills, the MCP server, a CLI, or all of them?

All three. Skills load Cloudflare knowledge into every Codex session (when to use Durable Objects, how to structure a Workers project, etc.). The Cloudflare API MCP server handles platform operations (DNS, WAF, Zero Trust). Wrangler handles local dev, deploys, and migrations. The bundled `wrangler` Skill teaches Codex when to run CLI commands vs. call the MCP API. For tasks across the whole Cloudflare API, Codex can also use the [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`.

Can Codex use the Cloudflare CLI?

Yes. The [Cloudflare CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/), `cf`, is in beta and covers the whole Cloudflare API and prints JSON output. Install it with `npm install -g cf`, sign in with `cf auth login`, and tell Codex to prefer it in `AGENTS.md`. Refer to [Use cf with AI agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cf/agents/).

How do I connect Codex to my Cloudflare account?

The first time Codex calls a Cloudflare tool, you will be redirected to authorize via OAuth and choose permissions.

Is Codex open source?

Yes. Codex is open source and available on GitHub at github.com/openai/codex.

## Troubleshooting

MCP server not connecting

Verify the server was added with `codex mcp add cloudflare --url https://mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`. Run `codex mcp list` to confirm it appears, then use `/mcp` inside the Codex TUI to check its status.

Getting outdated information about Cloudflare products

Point the agent directly at [developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt](https://developers.cloudflare.com/llms.txt) for a directory of every product, or `developers.cloudflare.com/<product>/llms.txt` for a product-specific index.

MCP server authentication fails

Remove and re-add the MCP server. Complete the OAuth flow in your browser when prompted.
