Overview401 Unauthorized Common use cases Cloudflare-specific information

## 401 Unauthorized

This error indicates that the request was not sent with the proper authentication credentials. The server requires authentication to process the request.

For more details, refer to [RFC 9110 ↗︎](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.2).

### Common use cases

A `401 Unauthorized` error occurs when the client fails to provide valid authentication credentials. The server responds with at least one challenge in the form of a `WWW-Authenticate` header field, as outlined in [section 4.1 ↗︎](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7235#section-4.1).

If the client resends the request with the same credentials and the challenge remains unchanged, the server may return an entity to assist the client in identifying the correct credentials needed.

### Cloudflare-specific information

When encountering a `401` error while using the Cloudflare API, ensure that you are providing the correct authentication credentials (for example, [API tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) or [keys](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/ca-keys/)). Double-check that the credentials are active and properly formatted. If the error persists, refer to the `WWW-Authenticate` header in the response for guidance on resolving the issue.

For a website or application, a `401` usually comes from the origin server, which requires authentication that the request did not provide. If the application is protected by [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/), Access can also return a `401` instead of redirecting to its login page, for example:

  * Requests that use a service token, when [strict service token authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/service-credentials/service-tokens/#strict-service-token-authentication) is on.
  * AJAX sub-requests with an [expired session](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/#ajax) that send the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header.
  * Non-browser clients, when [managed OAuth](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/applications/http-apps/managed-oauth/#authorization-flow) is enabled.
  * Non-browser traffic that fails Cloudflare One Client authentication, when [401 responses for non-browser traffic](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/access-settings/session-management/#return-401-responses-for-non-browser-traffic) are enabled.



To tell the two apart, check whether the request reached your origin server's logs.
