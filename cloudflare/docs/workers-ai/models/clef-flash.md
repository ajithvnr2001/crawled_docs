Clef-flash is a fast 9B multimodal decision model that turns a state and a schema of typed questions into decisions. It reads the state as text, JSON, images, or video, and returns a probability for every allowed option of every question.

How media inputs are billed

Clef models convert media inputs to input tokens and bill them at the model's input token rate. Clef models do not charge for output tokens. For per-model rates, refer to [pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing/).

Images are tokenized as follows:

  1. **Resize** : The image keeps its aspect ratio, but: 
     * Each side is rounded to a multiple of 32 pixels.
     * If the area is under about 65,000 pixels (256x256), it is scaled up to reach that.
     * If the area is over about 1 megapixel, it is scaled down to fit.
  2. **Count patches** : Each 32x32-pixel block is one token: `tokens = (width / 32) x (height / 32)`.
  3. **Add markers** : 3 tokens are added to mark where the image starts and ends.



Each image is capped at 1,024 tokens.

Media tokens count toward the model's context window, together with the questions. If they exceed the context window, the request fails. Otherwise, the text `state` is truncated to fit the remaining space.

## Usage
    
    
    export interface Env {
    	AI: Ai;
    }
    
    export default {
    	async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    		const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/cloudflare/clef-flash", {

    		});
    
    		// response.answers.urgent   -> probability the request is urgent
    		// response.answers.team     -> chosen team with per-option probabilities
    		// response.answers.severity -> probability-weighted score (0 = lowest level)
    		return Response.json(response);
