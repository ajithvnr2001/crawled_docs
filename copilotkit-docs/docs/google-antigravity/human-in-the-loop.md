See this in Inspector

Open Inspector on localhost. Go to **Agents** , then **Frontend Tools**. Your tool and its schema are listed.

More detail: [Inspector](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/google-antigravity/inspector).

## What is this?#

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) lets an agent pause mid-run to collect input, confirmation, or a choice from the user, then resume with that answer folded back into its reasoning. It's what turns an autonomous workflow into a collaborative one: the agent keeps its context, the user keeps the steering wheel.

## When should I use this?#

Use HITL when you need:

  * **Quality control** — a human gate at high-stakes decision points
  * **Edge cases** — graceful fallbacks when the agent's confidence is low
  * **Expert input** — lean on the user for domain knowledge the model lacks
  * **Reliability** — a more robust loop for real-world, production traffic



## Two patterns for HITL in CopilotKit#

### Install the Antigravity AG-UI adapter
    
    
    pip install ag-ui-antigravity google-antigravity

### Ask for the human with a frontend tool

The simplest route is an ordinary frontend tool. Register it in the browser with `useHumanInTheLoop`, or with `useFrontendTool` and an `async` handler that resolves once the user has answered. Each run carries that tool definition to the agent, the adapter rebuilds it as a custom Antigravity tool, and when the model calls it the call parks as an awaited coroutine — the SSE response for that run closes, and the adapter resolves the parked call from a later HTTP run with whatever the handler returned. The model receives that value as the tool's real return value, so there is no proxy tool and no fire-and-forget long-running-tool workaround.

### Or pause a server tool with `experimental_interrupt()`

When the backend decides it needs the user, a Python server tool can pause itself on an AG-UI interrupt with the adapter's experimental `experimental_interrupt()` and carry on with the answer:
    
    
    from ag_ui_antigravity import experimental_interrupt
    
    async def schedule_meeting(topic: str, attendee: str) -> str:
        """Books a meeting once the user picks a time."""
        answer = await experimental_interrupt(
            "schedule_meeting",
            message=f"Pick a time for {topic}",
            metadata={"topic": topic, "attendee": attendee},
        )
        if not answer.resolved:
            return f"Not scheduled ({answer.status})."
        return f"Scheduled for {answer.payload['chosen_label']}."

The run ends with `RUN_FINISHED` carrying an interrupt outcome, which `useInterrupt` renders; the payload the user resolves it with comes back unchanged in `answer.payload`. `answer.status` is `"resolved"`, `"cancelled"` or `"abandoned"` (the user sent a new message instead).

### Name the tool in the agent's instructions

That leaves the agent with one job: knowing the tool exists and when to call it. A model that is never told about `book_call` will answer in prose and the picker will never mount.

hitl.py
    
    
    from agents._common import build
    
    HITL_IN_CHAT_PROMPT = (
        "You help users book an onboarding call with the sales team. "
        "When they ask to book a call, call the frontend-provided "
        "`book_call` tool with a short topic and the user's name. "
        "Keep any chat reply to one short sentence."
    )
    
    
    def hitl_in_chat_agent():
        return build(system_instructions=HITL_IN_CHAT_PROMPT)
    
    

The frontend tool is dispatched to the browser at most once per turn (`deduplicate_tool_calls`, on by default), so a model that re-issues the same call after the harness backgrounds it does not ask the user twice.

ask_question is off in this showcase

Antigravity's own `ask_question` built-in tool — the one primitive that would park on a real AG-UI interrupt — is disabled here with `CapabilitiesConfig(enabled_tools=[BuiltinTools.FINISH])`. The CopilotKit demos answer a tool call with a `ToolMessage`, not an interrupt `resume`, so a turn that parked on `ask_question` would wait forever. `FINISH` has to stay enabled: it is how the harness ends a turn.

CopilotKit ships two complementary ways to pause an agent turn and ask the human something. They look similar from the outside (the chat pauses, a custom component appears, the user answers, the run resumes) but they're wired differently on the backend, and each has its own niche.

Pattern| Who decides to pause?| Backend surface  
---|---|---  
`useHumanInTheLoop`| The **LLM** , by calling a registered client-side tool| A frontend-only tool description (Zod schema + `render`)  
`useInterrupt`| The **graph** , by calling `interrupt(...)` during a node| A server-side `interrupt()` call in your LangGraph agent  
  
**Pick`useHumanInTheLoop`** when the pause is an _agent-initiated_ decision — the model chose to ask the user — and you want the picker UI inlined into the normal tool-call flow.

**Pick`useInterrupt`** when the pause is a _graph-enforced_ checkpoint — the code path deterministically requires a human answer — and you want `langgraph.interrupt()` as the server-side contract.

## Pattern 1 — `useHumanInTheLoop` (tool-based)#

The agent registers a HITL tool on the client with `useHumanInTheLoop`. When the LLM calls that tool, CopilotKit routes the call through your `render` function, which shows a custom component and calls `respond` with the user's answer. The agent sees the answer as the tool result and continues from there.

page.tsx
    
    
    import React from "react";import {  CopilotKit,  CopilotChat,  useHumanInTheLoop,  useConfigureSuggestions,} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";import { z } from "zod";import type { TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";import { TimePickerCard } from "./time-picker-card";const DEFAULT_SLOTS: TimeSlot[] = [  { label: "Tomorrow 10:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-19T10:00:00-07:00" },  { label: "Tomorrow 2:00 PM", iso: "2026-04-19T14:00:00-07:00" },  { label: "Monday 9:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-21T09:00:00-07:00" },  { label: "Monday 3:30 PM", iso: "2026-04-21T15:30:00-07:00" },];export default function HitlInChatDemo() {  return (    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="hitl-in-chat">      <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-full">        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-4xl">          <Chat />        </div>      </div>    </CopilotKit>  );}function Chat() {  useConfigureSuggestions({    suggestions: [      {        title: "Book a call with sales",        message:          "Please book an intro call with the sales team to discuss pricing.",      },      {        title: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice",        message: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice next week to review Q2 goals.",      },    ],    available: "always",  });  useHumanInTheLoop({    agentId: "hitl-in-chat",    name: "book_call",    description:      "Ask the user to pick a time slot for a call. The picker UI presents fixed candidate slots; the user's choice is returned to the agent.",    parameters: z.object({      topic: z        .string()        .describe("What the call is about (e.g. 'Intro with sales')"),      attendee: z        .string()        .describe("Who the call is with (e.g. 'Alice from Sales')"),    }),    render: ({ args, status, respond }: any) => (      <TimePickerCard        topic={args?.topic ?? "a call"}        attendee={args?.attendee}        slots={DEFAULT_SLOTS}        status={status}        onSubmit={(result) => respond?.(result)}      />    ),  });

The picker UI is fed a static list of candidate slots — this is just data the demo page owns, so you can swap in real availability, a calendar API, or anything else:

page.tsx
    
    
    import React from "react";import {  CopilotKit,  CopilotChat,  useHumanInTheLoop,  useConfigureSuggestions,} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";import { z } from "zod";import type { TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";import { TimePickerCard } from "./time-picker-card";const DEFAULT_SLOTS: TimeSlot[] = [  { label: "Tomorrow 10:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-19T10:00:00-07:00" },  { label: "Tomorrow 2:00 PM", iso: "2026-04-19T14:00:00-07:00" },  { label: "Monday 9:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-21T09:00:00-07:00" },  { label: "Monday 3:30 PM", iso: "2026-04-21T15:30:00-07:00" },];

## Pattern 2 — `useInterrupt` (graph-paused)#

With LangGraph's `interrupt()` the pause is enforced by the graph itself: a node calls `interrupt({...})`, the run suspends, the client receives the payload, renders a UI, and resumes the run with the user's answer. CopilotKit's `useInterrupt` hook is the render contract.

See the [`useInterrupt` deep dive](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/google-antigravity/human-in-the-loop/useInterrupt) for the full walkthrough, including the backend tool and render-prop wiring.

Not supported on Google Antigravity

Google Antigravity doesn't support Human in the Loop: Interrupts. See [the framework grid](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/) for which integrations support this feature.

## Going headless#

Both patterns above ship with a `render` prop — CopilotKit handles the "when to show the picker" logic for you. If you want to drive interrupt resolution from a custom UI that lives anywhere in the tree (not necessarily inside a chat), see the [headless interrupts guide](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/google-antigravity/human-in-the-loop/headless) — it shows how to compose `useAgent`, `agent.subscribe`, and `copilotkit.runAgent` to build your own `useInterrupt` equivalent.
